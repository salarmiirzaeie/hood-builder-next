    "post_content": "<a href=\"https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2016/01/24/19/49/kitchen-1159532_1280.jpg\">Source</a>\n<strong>Denver, CO - </strong>Hood cleaning is a necessary process all commercial kitchens, <a href=\"/services/food-trucks-design-fire-suppression-installation-services/\">food trucks</a>, and other establishments must go through in order to lawfully maintain their status as a healthy restaurant. It’s also a safety precaution because the most common cause of fire in commercial kitchens is a dirty hood.\nThe process takes about 3 to 6 hours, depending on the size of the kitchen. Most businesses <a href=\"/\">hire a cleaning company</a> in order to do this because it provides them with the safest, most professional option possible. However, if you’re thinking about trying it yourself, here are the steps that our cleaners take when cleaning hoods.\n<b>Step One: Preparation</b>\nThe kitchen must be prepared for the process of cleaning. This means the pilot lights and gas valves must be turned off and then covered with tarps. This way, the equipment won’t get splashed with any grease. The hood must also be wrapped in plastic, which is then funneled into a container in order to catch the greasy water.\n<b>Step Two: Cleaning</b>\n<strong> </strong>The grease baffle filters are removed and soaked in chemical tanks. This process takes a few hours. After they soak, the filters are then pressure washed. The ductwork needs to be cleaned, which begins with manual scraping of all the grease that has hardened in this area. Cleaners will then spray chemicals into the ductwork, which needs to set for about an hour.\nWhile this process continues, cleaners will remove the exhaust fans and spray them with chemicals. The fan belt is also pressure washed in order to remove the grease. At this point in the process, the hood is also manually scraped and sprayed down. Once the chemicals in the spray have loosened the grease, pressure washing follows. Finally, the entire system receives a pressure wash, and the spray goes from top to bottom, so all the greasy runoff will end up in the container.\n<b>Step Three: Inspection</b>\n<strong> </strong>After all the pressure washing and deep cleaning, it is time for the parts of your exhaust system to be replaced. Tests are also run to make sure the exhaust system is working. The cleaners will put a sticker certifying that the system was cleaned on each hood, when it was cleaned, and when the next cleaning is due. During this process, cleaners will also make sure to wipe down the system, clean the floors, and turn the gas back on so that the kitchen is in excellent condition when they leave.\n<b>When It’s Time to Call the Professionals</b>\n\n<strong> </strong>These steps may seem overwhelming to you, especially if you’re busy running your business.

    "post_content": "<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/en/sign-fire-alert-danger-grunge-1128804/\">Source</a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Denver, CO -</strong> Disaster can strike at any time without warning. That’s the reason why <a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/%3Cfront%3E/fire-protection\">fire protection supplies</a> form an essential part of any office or Commercial Kitchen and restaurants. While most offices have fire extinguishers in place, upgrading your protection supplies is an investment that is never in vain. Offices have sensitive equipment and other valuables that are costly to lose in a fire. But what happens when the fire protection system itself does more harm than good?\r\n\r\nYes, believe it or not, chemical fire protection systems can often cause more damage to the things that they are supposed to protect. The uncertainty that comes with these systems has led to the development of a new and innovative fire protection solution—clean agents.\r\n<h2>What Is A Clean Agent Fire Protection System?</h2>\r\nA clean agent system is a fire protection solution that is completely waterless and activates immediately upon sensing a fire. The most important feature of this system is that it leaves no watery or oily residue behind to damage priceless assets.\r\n\r\nBefore you decide to install the clean agent fire protection system in your home or office, you must be familiar with its mechanism. Clean agents use a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaseous_fire_suppression\">gaseous substance</a> to put out fires. Some of the approved clean agents are CO2 or FM-200.\r\n\r\nWhen this system is installed in an establishment, cylinders containing the clean agent are stored in a protected space, and connected to the entire building through the use of special pipes.\r\n\r\nWhen there is an indication of a fire, electronic signals are sent to the cylinders that release the clean agent only into space where smoke or fire has been detected. This <a href=\"/services/fire-suppression-systems/pyrochem/\">advanced fire protection system</a> usually responds in less than ten seconds, and also has the ability to close doors and vents to prevent the fire from spreading. The clean agent works by depleting the oxygen content to kill the fire.\r\n\r\nLearn More About: <a href=\"/range-guard-fire-suppression-system-necessities/\"> Does Your Commercial Kitchen Range Guard Fire Suppression System Have These 10 Must-Haves?</a>\r\n<h2>Benefits of Clean Agents</h2>\r\nThere are several benefits of a clean agent fire protection system, as compared to water or other fire extinguishing agents. Some of these are:\r\n\r\n<strong>Fast:</strong> Most fire protection services choose clean agent systems because they are faster than other fire extinguishing methods. The system is built to reach the fire in ten seconds or less.\r\n\r\n<strong>Safe: </strong> Clean agents are non-conductive and safe to use around electronics and electrical equipment. This system is not hazardous and also safe to use around humans.\r\n\r\n<strong>No Residue: </strong> For the commercial kitchen, clean agents are a non-messy alternative to other fire protection systems. They don’t leave any residue behind, and the gas they produce evaporates to leave food preparation areas clean.\r\n\r\n<strong>Simple to install: </strong> No matter how small your commercial space, <a href=\"http://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/all-codes-and-standards/list-of-codes-and-standards/detail?code=2001\">clean agent systems</a> are easy to install, and the cylinders are small enough to store safely and conveniently.\r\n\r\n<strong>Eco-Friendly: </strong> Since these gaseous substances don’t leave any residue behind, they are safe for the environment too, with ozone-depleting potential.\r\n\r\n<strong>If you are seeking expert hood services in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, and other locales across the U.S. look no further than Hood Builder.

    "post_content": "<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/en/restaurant-kitchen-chefs-cooks-2623071/\">Source</a>\r\n\r\n<strong>Salt Lake City, UT -</strong> The majority of restaurant and eatery owners already understand the responsibilities of operating a commercial kitchen, including cleanliness for food hygiene purposes. However, proper cleaning should also incorporate a thorough cleaning of the establishment’s ventilation systems to prevent future problems.\r\n\r\nGrease, dust, and cooking odors can build-up within HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) units and cooker hood systems, significantly increasing the risk of sparking a fire. While the majority of commercial kitchen facilities maintain a fire suppression system, it’s still possible that grease build-up within cooker hood units or exhaust fan filters could increase the risk of fire.\r\n\r\nStatistics published by the National Fire Protection Authority (NFPA) show that 61% of fires reported in eating and drinking establishments were caused by cooking equipment and cause around $165 million in direct <a href=\"http://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Fire-statistics-and-reports/Fire-statistics/Fires-by-property-type/Assemblies/Eating-and-drinking-establishments\">property damage losses annually</a>. The same statistics also reveal that cooking materials were the first item to ignite during 43% of the commercial kitchen fires reported.\r\n\r\nThe NFPA also recognizes that kitchen ventilation systems feature prominently in the number of commercial kitchen fire events reported each year.\r\n\r\nGrease is highly combustible, especially when it is allowed to accumulate within baffle filters. grease trap cleaning regularly can reduce the potential fire hazard lurking in cooker hood and exhaust ventilation systems.\r\n\r\nDepending on the size of the kitchen, grease trap cleaning is a process that can take between 3 and 6 hours. The majority of commercial kitchen owners <a href=\"/services/hoods/cleaning/\">hire a professional hood cleaning company</a> capable of removing, cleaning, and pressure washing filters and ductwork properly.\r\n\r\nAside from reducing the potential fire hazard, a professionally cleaned HVAC system also improves the quality of air circulating through the establishment, efficiently replenishing depleted oxygen and preventing carbon dioxide build-up. It also ensures staff and customers are breathing clean air with reduced cooking odors.\r\n\r\nLearn More About: <a href=\"/commercial-grease-trap-cleaning-services-importance/\"><span>Why You Should Be Putting Effort into Selecting the Best Commercial Grease Trap Cleaning Services</span></a>\r\n\r\n<strong>If your commercial HVAC systems and kitchen grease trap cleaning need professional cleaning, call Hood Builder at <a href=\"tel:+1-303-777-7720\"> (303) 777-7720)</a> for a full, fast-price quote. </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>About us: </strong>Hood Builder has been providing a diverse range of professional HVAC maintenance, hood installation, and cleaning services to clients in Cheyenne, Wyoming, Salt Lake City, Utah, San Francisco, or Colorado for more than 25 years.\r\n\r\n<em>© 2017 Millionairium and Farazandeh.

    "post_content": "<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/en/oldtimer-auto-classic-old-kiosk-2436018/\">Source</a>\n\n<strong>Denver, CO -</strong> Building a food truck you intend to cook on involves lots of planning and designing before you begin construction. You’ll need to include space for food preparation and storage, as well as cooking equipment, fryers, or grills for cooking your food items.\n\nYour design needs to incorporate sufficient space for food storage, food preparation areas, refrigerator, freezer, heat lamps, and any other equipment you use to prepare your dishes. The <a href=\"/services/food-trucks-design-fire-suppression-installation-services/\">food truck design</a> you choose must factor in any space taken up by ventilation or exhaust fans, as you also need to ensure your work area is properly ventilated.\n\nYour truck also needs to carry generators, propane gas bottles, and freshwater tanks. Then there’s the consideration of including the right amount of serving space and cash registers or payment processing machinery.\n\nEven if your kitchen and servery design are perfect for your <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/\">food truck’s needs</a>, you also need to take into account the mechanical aspects of your truck. The engine and transmission need to be powerful enough to haul the added weight of a mobile kitchen around town. It also needs to be reliable enough to get you to and from your chosen location each day.\n\nWhen your design is done and it’s time to start arranging construction, stop and take a moment to think about a few other considerations you might have overlooked.\n<h2>Fire Safety</h2>\nCommercial kitchens within large restaurants or cafés are required to adhere to strict regulations when it comes to fire safety. If they hope to pass inspection, they must meet UL-300 requirements set by the National Fire Prevention Association (NFPA).\n\nFood trucks are no different. Your <a href=\"/services/food-trucks-design-fire-suppression-installation-services/\">food truck design</a> is a compact space that is much smaller than a restaurant, but it’s still a commercial kitchen.\n\nYou will need to ensure you have the correct fire extinguishers and fire suppression systems installed. Not only will you have to worry about combating hot-burning cooking fires, such as those sparked by deep fryers or within grease filters, but there are also fires that could spark within compacted hoods and ventilation systems to consider.\n\nYour food truck is also carrying propane gas, which is highly combustible and may require different fire suppression systems than those used for kitchen or cooking fires.\n\nBefore finalizing your <a href=\"/services/food-trucks-design-fire-suppression-installation-services/\">food truck construction design</a>, take the time to discuss your needs with the team at Hood Builder.

    "post_content": "<b>Denver, CO -</b> Maintenance is vital to the growth of any business especially one that runs on an engine, such as a mobile food business. A lot of times business owners put maintenance off thinking they can go another day, or another week, until their <a href=\"/services/food-trucks-design-fire-suppression-installation-services/\">food truck</a> malfunctions. By this time, it’s too late.\n\nNow, not only are they going to have to close up shop until repairs are made, but they also end up spending way more than they would have paid <a href=\"/services/food-trucks-design-fire-suppression-installation-services/\">doing regular maintenance</a>. This procrastination is not a healthy practice for your food truck business. The bottom line is, you can’t afford to have a food truck that keeps breaking down.\n\nHere are some maintenance tips to keep your restaurant on the go operating as needed to keep business running as usual.\n\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mobile-food-trailer-for-sale-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"mobile kitchen - food trailers - food truck\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-2007 size-large\" />\n<h2>Food Truck Cleaning</h2>\nApart from mechanical maintenance, it is also essential to have a clean food truck, as food preparation can leave grease stains, food residue, vapor, and smoke on food handling surfaces and crevices in the kitchen.\n\nThis accumulation could cause your kitchen to become unsanitary. Your everyday washing/cleaning habits, even if they are top-notch, cannot possibly eliminate all of the grease and debris buildups. If this goes unattended, the grit and grime on surfaces, especially around the stove and fryer areas, become a fire hazard.\n\nThis increased grit and grime creates unsanitary conditions in your kitchen which can lead to food contamination and sick customers. And customers who fall ill are sure to spread the word that something is afoul with your business. Unfortunately, bad news spreads faster than good news. Don’t take the chance. Keep the health inspector happy and your customers feeling great by scheduling <a href=\"/services/food-trucks-design-fire-suppression-installation-services/\">full-service food truck cleaning</a>.\n\nThis is why it’s so important to have your food truck regularly cleaned and serviced. Not only will this prevent your vehicle from going completely out of commission, but it will also save you money, time, and embarrassment. Our experts at Hood Builder recommend that you have your food truck cleaned at least two times a year. A thorough cleaning covers:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Stove and fryer back cleaning</li>\n \t<li>Exhaust hood cleaning</li>\n \t<li>Walls and floors</li>\n \t<li>Freezer cleaning</li>\n</ul>\nThese are areas not regularly covered by routine cleaning. Performing a full cleaning ensures that all food handling surfaces and appliances are free from germs and bacteria that could contaminate food. It will also improve your health inspection score.\n\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mobile-commercial-kitchen-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"food truck rentals - food truck builders\" width=\"960\" height=\"640\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2006 size-large\" />\n<h2>Food Truck Maintenance and Servicing</h2>\nAccording to our experts, your mobile kitchen also needs to be examined and serviced at least twice yearly.

    "post_content": "<a href=\"https://pixabay.com/en/chiller-refrigerator-fridge-2764998/\">Image Source</a>\r\n<strong>Denver, CO -</strong> Ideal restaurant kitchen design takes everything into account, from space planning and storage space to fixtures and furnishings, equipment specifications, and procurement. Expert engineers, designers, and contractors work together to <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/design/\">design practical restaurant kitchens</a> that not only look exceptional but remain practical for all day-to-day operations. Perhaps one of the most overlooked design aspects is <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/equipment/\">commercial refrigeration</a>.\r\nImaging buying ingredients one day just to throw them out the next. If you can’t keep your food properly stored and temperature conditioned, your food costs will quickly eat a hole in your pocket. That’s why the experts at Hood Builder have offered these tips for optimum kitchen refrigeration.\r\n<h2>Get Professional Help:</h2>\r\nA functional layout and proper refrigeration are crucial to the success of your food business. Your industrial food preparation space has to be carefully planned and designed to flow from one cooking stage to the next. <a href=\"/\">Hiring an experienced professional</a> can help you avoid mistakes. For example, a professional can give you advice on where your hood vents should be installed for maximum performance. They can also assist you with where to position your fire prevention systems and even advise you on the best equipment.\r\n<h2>Invest in commercial refrigeration:</h2>\r\nNever use household equipment for industrial purposes. The refrigeration system in your industrial kitchen must have the capacity to keep foods fresh, especially raw meat and dairy products. Packing a storage cooler reduces its functionality. It's more efficient to choose a commercial unit with enough space to handle your ingredients.\r\n<h2>Choose your commercial fridge according to what will be on your menu:</h2>\r\nWhen choosing a fridge for your business, you must consider what your main ingredients are, and what quantities you will need per time period. This will help you determine what kind of refrigeration system you need. For example: if you are running a gourmet restaurant that requires a lot of meat and fresh foods, you will need one that has separate storage compartments for meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs.\r\n\r\nThe frozen compartment should preferably be at the bottom of the fridge for easy access and to prevent cross-contamination. For example, if raw meat juices were to leak, they would never interact with foods that don’t require cooking, such as lettuce, or tomatoes for salads.\r\n<h2>Think about how often you will be getting deliveries:</h2>\r\nAnother important thing to consider is how often you will receive deliveries. If your ingredients are delivered or purchased on a daily basis, your need for refrigeration will be a lot less than if you need to receive deliveries on a weekly basis. In that case, you need adequate cold storage to keep your food fresh until the next delivery date.\r\n<h2>Plan for bulk ingredient purchases:</h2>\r\nWhat does buying in bulk have to do with refrigeration? Everything! Buying in bulk substantially reduces your cost. An entire case of butter (24 sticks) for $29.99 instead of 2 sticks at a time for $1.99 each, will save $17.77. That is smart and economical for your business but if you have to have adequate storage.\r\n\r\nStill, need help deciding?

If your <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/\">vent system</a> isn’t working properly, the air may become unbreathable or downright unsafe. Then there is the risk of fire due to the buildup for grease and other flammable materials. This means that, whether you run a restaurant in a hotel or hospital, or your vent system keeps your <a href=\"/services/food-trucks-design-fire-suppression-installation-services/\">food truck</a> running like clockwork for your hungry customers, you must inspect your <a href=\" /faq/\">vent hoods, fans, and other ventilation components regularly</a> to ensure everything is working as it should.\nIf you smell smoke, the air has become too hot, there is a buildup of grease, or you merely suspect that your ventilation system isn’t working as it should (as in your energy bills are sky-high), these are the steps to take to troubleshoot and fix your problem as soon as possible.\n<h2>Common Ventilation System Problems to Watch For</h2>\n<ol>\n \t<li><b>Check for Power:</b> This may seem like a silly tip to give to a professional in charge of operating a commercial kitchen, but we don’t just mean check the power switch. Check the breakers, wiring, and all other power components that keep your vent hoods and fans operating efficiently. If anything looks amiss, a professional vent hood maintenance crew should be called out immediately.</li>\n \t<li><b>Call the Power Company:</b> A 3-phase hood motor could shut down due to what is known as a “Phase Loss.” You’ll know this is the problem if there are sections of your restaurant where the lights are out or if there are other kitchen components that aren’t working, such as an electric oven. If you suspect a phase loss is your issue, call the power company to resolve it.</li>\n \t<li><b>Defective Motor:</b> In some cases, a motor that is going out of whack will trip your breaker. If you find yourself continually resetting the breaker, it may not be a fuse issue at all. The best move would be to call a professional ventilation motor specialist to repair or replace the faulty component entirely.</li>\n \t<li><b>Check the Motor Starters:</b> The motor starters are typically located behind an access panel on the right or left side of the vent hood. Once the access panel is removed, you should see a “trip button” and the reset button. Push the button if the system has been tripped. If the motor starts up again only to “trip” once more, you likely have a defective ventilation hood motor. Call a specialist to replace the motor to get your commercial kitchen back up to quality standards.</li>\n \t<li><b>Inspect the Service Switch:</b> On the roof of your commercial establishment, you should notice a service switch. If the switch is off, turn it on. If it’s on and your <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/equipment/\">ventilation system still isn’t working</a>, the professionals are the ones to call.</li>\n \t<li><b>Listen for a Rattle:</b> When running your vent hood fans, do they make a rattling sound? If so, you might have something loose that could soon break free. It’s best not to wait. Your fan or the components that operate the fan may need to be replaced.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Regular Maintenance Prevents Future Problems</h2>\nThe best way to keep your commercial kitchen running optimally all the year through is to schedule frequent maintenance by the ventilation hood experts. These maintenance service calls can be completed on your schedule so that downtime is minimized, and convenience maximized. Your staff and customers will thank you, and your kitchen will maintain optimum efficiency, even during the busiest lunch or dinner rushes.\n<b>To learn more about ventilation system maintenance, repair, and troubleshooting, call Hood Builder, the leader in vent hoods, <a href=\"/services/food-trucks-design-fire-suppression-installation-services/\">food truck construction</a>, and more, serving Denver, CO.

    "post_content": "<a href=\"https://www.rewardsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Ready_to_Remodel_Main.jpg\">Image Source</a>\n<b>Restaurant Remodelling &amp; Construction in Denver, CO –</b> Every restaurant owner wants to provide the best possible experience for his or her customers, and sometimes that means changing things up in a big way. Evolution is essential to staying relevant in this ever-changing industry, and reinvesting in your business can produce amazing results.\n\nThere’s a lot of competition in pretty much every market, and customers not only respond to shiny and new, but to efficiency and comfort. As restaurants grow, their needs change. What worked when you started your business may not be working as well now, and <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/remodeling/\">remodeling your restaurant</a> may be in order.\n<h2>Step One: Find the Right Company for the Job</h2>\nRemodeling is no small investment with an average cost of $160 a square foot, according to <a href=\"http://blog.sweeten.com/commercial-reno/commercial-101/cost-breakdown-restaurant-renovation-cost/\">Building Journal</a>. If you don’t have the cash on hand to pay for the project, you may have to look into small business loans. Even with funding secured, you may not be able to have all of the new equipment or floor covering you want. It’s important to keep your expectations reasonable, and the right team will focus on getting the best possible outcome for your budget.\n\nOnce you’ve secured the funding for your renovation project, the first step in the remodeling process is creating a design. Find a company that will work with you to ensure your vision is met. The right company will put you at ease during what may seem like an overwhelming process.\n\nIf you don’t have a design already planned out, the company you choose will have trained professionals who will help you get the look and feel you want for your space. They will also guide you every step of the way so you can be positive no stones are left unturned.\n\nYou may be concerned that you’ll have to close your doors during the renovation process, but if you choose a qualified company, they will work with your business’ hours of operation and stay in the background until the job is complete. Keep in mind that it may take a few weeks or a few months to get your space where you want it to be, depending on the size of the project and what needs to be done.\n<h2>Step Two: Obtain the Proper Permits</h2>\nEvery remodeling project comes with government red tape to get through. A restaurant renovation will involve the health department, fire department, gas company, and your city’s buildings department. It may seem like a hassle, but it’s important to <a href=\"http://www.ladbs.org/services/core-services/plan-check-permit\">make sure the right paperwork is filed</a> so some seemingly minor detail doesn’t fall through the cracks and prevent you from having the restaurant of your dreams.\n<h2>Step Three: Make Sure Your Space Is up to Code</h2>\nThe company you choose to work with you on your renovation endeavor will be well-versed in building codes and the requirements restaurants must adhere to. You may have a great idea for foot traffic and table arrangement, but that idea might pose safety concerns such as fire hazards.\n\nA restaurant remodel is a big investment, but it could pay off in a big way. Your customers will thank you for spending more time and money in your establishment, and your staff will thank you for providing them with a space that meets their needs.\n\n<b>If you’re considering remodeling your restaurant, <a href=\"tel: +1-303-777-7720\">call Hood Builder</a> or contact us to get the ball rolling on creating your ideal food and beverage space. We’ll work with you to make your dream restaurant a reality. </b>\n\n<i>© 2018 Millionairium and Farazandeh.

The smiling faces of your loyal customers as they meet your truck on familiar street corners, there’s no better feeling in the world. Of course, the food truck business isn’t always fun and games. There will be the occasional disgruntled customer, insufficient inventory orders, and spoiled food that can make the food truck business difficult, but those are normal occurrences. One problem you’ll definitely want to avoid at all costs has to do with a proper commercial kitchen and <a href=\"/services/food-trucks-design-fire-suppression-installation-services/\">food truck</a> construction.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\n\n<h2>The Proper Way to Construct a Food Truck</h2>\n<b>Your Equipment Must Match Cooking Volume</b>\nYour food truck needs to be able to accommodate the volume of cooking you’ll plan to do each day. If your truck is only open for lunch on Tuesdays and Thursdays, for example, you won’t need near the expanse or capabilities of a truck that’s open seven days per week, 365 days per year, and all through the day and evening.\nWhile few food trucks produce that type of volume, operating a food truck without the ability to satisfy your projected clientele is a recipe for disaster. Your food truck should be, for one, ergonomically designed, so that getting to critical areas is easy and straight-forward. The last time you want to twist and bend over, especially when working with several people, is during a busy lunch rush. Instead, place equipment within easy reach of all staff, as your days will go by easier, your body will have less wear and tear, things won’t get so crazy, and your customers will enjoy a more satisfactory food truck experience.\n\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Food-Truck-Construction-Eliminate-Problems-Hood-Builder-Denver-Colorado-scaled-e1605509979869-871x1024.jpg\" alt=\"Food Truck Construction Eliminate Problems Hood Builder Denver Colorado food truck manufacturers\" width=\"871\" height=\"1024\" class=\"wp-image-2010 size-large aligncenter\" />\n<h2>Equipment Must Pass Health Inspection</h2>\n<a href=\"/services/food-trucks-design-fire-suppression-installation-services/\">Your food truck should be easy to maintain and clean</a>, and that goes for all cooking and food preparation equipment. The last thing you want is for your custom <a href=\"/mobile-dining-from-chuck-wagons-modern-food-trucks/\">food truck</a> to get shut down because of excessive grease build-up or a machine that’s so faulty it’s downright dangerous.\nWhen <a href=\"/services/food-trucks-design-fire-suppression-installation-services/\">constructing your food truck</a>, ensure you get the best equipment your money can buy. It should be energy efficient and designed to serve up the food you intend to prepare so that it’s hot and ready.\n<h2>The Truck Must Be in Good Working Order</h2>\nIt’s only until after they begin operating that most food truck owners realize that truck driving is part of the job. As with any vehicle, your custom food truck should be built to last. It should be maintained on a regular schedule and parts should be switched out with new parts whenever possible.\nKeep an eye on the tires, too, and keep the alignment balanced. A food truck with a flat tire won’t make much money that day unless you happen to break down in a popular intersection filled with hungry people.\nThe bottom line is that from the equipment to the engine to the tires that keep your food truck on the road, ensure that the experts have your best interests in mind, from bumper to bumper.\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\nThe reasons for operating a food truck are numerous. The startup is one of the lowest in the hospitality industry and there’s a high return for potential. <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/john-white/why-food-truck-businesses-are-revving-up.html\">Food truck owners tend to reap between $250K and $500K</a> on average. It’s also tons of fun. If you like to serve food and make people happy, and you want to operate a lucrative business in the heart of your favorite city, considering order a food truck, constructed the right away of course.\n<b>You can get a food truck that’s built-to-order by calling or emailing Hood Builder, serving clients throughout Colorado,  and other states around the nation.</b>\n<i>© 2018 Millionairium and Farazandeh.

Everyone, from the chef to the prep cooks, to the servers and dishwashers--must work together in harmony to achieve customer satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the night, or by the end of the week, it's hard to keep them motivated to hang up their aprons and deep clean your facility the way it should be cleaned--thoroughly and diligently.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What your staff can handle</h2>\r\nRegular kitchen and restaurant staff should be trained and adept at routine tidying up. For example, the floors in the kitchen should be unobstructed by spills and large fallen pieces of food or packaging. Waiters and hostesses should keep tables and seating areas wiped down and register de-greased and dusted.\r\n\r\nHowever, every month or so, it is wise to order professional commercial cleaning service specialists. They have high power equipment and an efficient crew that can refresh your space like no surface tidying can.\r\n<h2>Commercial Kitchen Cleaning &amp; Restaurant Kitchen Cleaning service makes a difference</h2>\r\nWhen you order professional <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/cleaning/\">kitchen cleaning</a>, your dining room floor will be cleaned spotless by a commercial grade vacuum. Your booths will be scrubbed clean and polished, and your kitchen floor will be stripped of grease and stubborn stains.\r\n<h2>Hood vent cleaning and grease filter cleaning</h2>\r\nMost importantly, there are parts of your kitchen that are difficult or even dangerous to clean if you are not familiar with what you are doing. <a href=\"/services/hoods/cleaning/\">Hood vents</a> and grease traps for instance, if not cleaned of grease buildup thoroughly--will remain a combustion risk in your establishment.\r\n\r\nA professional company that does this service knows exactly how to take apart all the cleanable parts of your <a href=\"/services/hvac/\">HVAC system</a>, including grease filters, hoods, and ducts, soak them, and then put them back together correctly. This kind of job is certainly not common knowledge, but it's essential that it's done correctly.\r\n<h2>Show off your clean space with pride</h2>\r\nYour facility--both the public seating area and the ‘back of the house’ aspect--will be presentable to any curious food blogger or health standards agent. With the help of commercial kitchen cleaning services from Hood Builder, you never have to be ashamed of any part of your business again!\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in getting a quote for your commercial kitchen cleaning job, <a href=\"/contact-us/\">call us for services in Denver</a>.\r\n\r\n<i>© 2018 Millionairium and Farazandeh.

However, it is often a very stressful time. Most restaurant owners are not architects or interior designers—they are passionate food experts.\r\n\r\n<span>Yet, the process of creating a brand new eating establishment demands a great deal of building code knowledge and experience that only <a href=\"/services/general-contracting/\">contractors experienced in restaurant building</a> can possess. Here’s a look at how hiring the right team of contractors and designers will save your sanity, letting you concentrate on what really matters.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>They Will Find Big Problems Before It’s Too Late</h2>\r\nIf there is a serious structural problem (load-bearing wall issues, sinking foundations) or a hidden termite problem--these problems could easily go undetected. An amateur team could miss these and only discover such surprises when you are so far into the project that there may not be the money cushion to deal with them easily anymore. This is not to mention how much these things interfere with and delay construction when they are detected late in the game.\r\nEstablished professionals tend to look for issues right away, before even giving you a price quote, and they remain vigilant for problems as they uncover more of the building during demolition.\r\n<h2>Price Quotes Will be More Accurate</h2>\r\n<span>When you are working with a contracting team that has built out restaurant spaces before, they know exactly how much the equipment specific to restaurant kitchens costs for the size of the establishment you hope to achieve. <a href=\"/services/general-contracting/\">Experts</a> that have done this dozen of times will know exactly how much material will be necessary and how much it will cost. </span>\r\n\r\n<span>Also, good restaurant designers and builders will help you to articulate your wishes for the restaurant in the drawing phase, so it will be less likely that you will feel part of your vision for space was lost in translation. This will help avoid last-minute additions to the building plan--and to your budget.</span>\r\n<h2>Passing Codes: They Will Design with Fire Safety, HVAC, and Ventilation in Mind</h2>\r\n<span>A team like the one we have at Hoodbuilder--that specializes in <a href=\"/services/general-contracting/\">fire protection,</a> <a href=\"/services/hvac/\">HVAC</a>, <a href=\"/services/hoods/\">hood install and cleaning</a> and <a href=\"/services/hvac/ventilation/\">ventilation</a>, as well as <a href=\"/services/general-contracting/\">contracting</a>--is truly an example of a whole package for restaurant design.

    "post_content": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ventilation is an important issue for every restaurant. In a commercial restaurant, there are many areas that also need safety from different kinds of hazards at all times. If you are a restaurant owner, the responsibility of keeping your employees and customers safe is something you can never ignore.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A large restaurant is a hub of activities - food preparation, food serving, collecting pots, cleaning, unloading equipment, etc. A busy restaurant also receives a lot of customers throughout its hours of operation. To keep the restaurant business growing and everyone inside it safe, you should make sure that the distinct areas of the restaurant are free from safety hazards and odor. Customers will stop visiting a restaurant that is smelly. Fumes created by the cooking processes in the kitchen will make it difficult for the employees to work efficiently.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, it is crucial that your restaurant is fitted with a good <a href=\"/services/hvac/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">HVAC system</a> for proper ventilation and indoor comfort.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>What is an HVAC System?</h2>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An HVAC system is comprised of multiple components all of which work together to keep a restaurant or any other large environment well-ventilated. Designed by experts, the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system function on the principles of heat transfer and thermodynamics.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Installation of the HVAC system is mandatory by law in places where the temperature and the humidity should not exceed a specific limit. You must have come across these critical systems installed at the top of large office buildings, residential complexes, and business establishments. Just like the set up of a <a href=\"/services/hvac/heating/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">heating</a> and air-conditioning system is crucial in other large places, it is also extremely important in large or commercial restaurants and kitchens. There are different types of HVAC systems to match the varying needs of large buildings and restaurants.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basically, an HVAC system is designed in a way that can either heat or cools a place as per the weather requirements. Key components that make up this system include an expansion valve, an evaporator, a compressor, a condenser, and a receiver drier. Depending on the function the system needs to perform in a place, they can be customized to suit specific needs.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Restaurant HVAC System Installation</h2>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For your restaurant business to thrive, you need to keep your restaurant fitted with all the essential appliances, equipment, and systems. Among these, the HVAC system is the most critical to your day-to-day operation. If you are planning to get new heating, <a href=\"/services/hvac/air-conditioning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">air conditioning</a>, and ventilation system installed in your restaurant, you should only work with a professional HVAC system contractor. This will ensure that you get the project completed without any errors and on time.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are new to the HVAC system installation, it’s a good idea to make yourself familiar with the key steps of the process.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>System Size Calculation:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the HVAC system is installed in your restaurant kitchen, the targeted area has to be measured. A professional contractor inspects the space where you want the installation to be placed and then calculates the size of the system properly to fit specific needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>New Ductwork Installation:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your restaurant’s air-conditioning needs an upgrade, the contractor will examine the old ductwork for proficiency. Depending on its condition, the existing ductwork may need to be replaced in part. In the case of fairly recent ductwork, some minor repairs are all you need. Next, the contractor will seal and insulate the ductwork so that there’s no leakage anywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Airflow Adjustment:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each air-conditioner comes with its specifications for airflow. It’s the responsibility of the HVAC contractor to pick the right specifications, as required by your commercial kitchen. The contractor will test each distinct section of your restaurant to ensure the cooling is uniform all over. Airflow adjustment is a critical task and can only be accomplished by experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Refrigerant Level Verification:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High cooling costs are a big concern for anyone who is running a commercial restaurant. This often happens because the level of refrigerant is set below the prescribed level. So, before the air-conditioning system is turned on, the HVAC contractor will conduct verification and make sure that the refrigerant is charged to an adequate level.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The installation of the restaurant kitchen HVAC should always be done by a professional contractor who has several years of experience. If it’s not done properly or there are errors, you can face multiple problems. Incorrect HVAC installation will increase the energy cost, first of all. Getting the HVAC system repaired can be expensive. Or else, you may need to replace the entire restaurant air-conditioning system with a new one while losing a lot of money in the process.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>HVAC System Challenges for Commercial Kitchen</h2>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The kitchen is the backbone of a restaurant. The kitchen is where the food is prepared and therefore this is the area where ventilation is needed the most. The <a href=\"/services/hvac/ventilation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ventilation</a> needs vary from one kitchen to another.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>High Temperature:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A large kitchen remains packed with a wide variety of appliances to carry out cooking processes. There is other equipment that helps with dishwashing and cleaning. All of this together raise the kitchen temperature to a level which is unsafe for the staff working there. During summers, increased temperatures cause even more trouble, which is simply unbearable. Besides, normal kitchen temperature also has a negative effect on the restaurant’s business.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not keeping the kitchen temperature within the optimum range can reduce the productivity of employees and cause accidents.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Fumes, Smoke, and Grease:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cooking fills the air in the kitchen with particulate matter from smoke and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grease_duct\">grease</a>. The suspended particulates make the kitchen atmosphere unhealthy for employees. That’s exactly why every state has a set of regulations that have to be followed by restaurants. Installing ventilation hoods helps keep kitchen air uncontaminated from particulates and, therefore, keeps the kitchen staff protected from various types of respiratory ailments.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Fire Suppression:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s important to keep a commercial kitchen safe from any kind of fire hazards. There are building codes that you need to follow to avoid accidents that can happen due to fire. Installation of a fire suppression system helps you prevent the occurrence of fire and quickly put out the fire in case it happens. The fire suppression system uses an inert gas along with other chemicals that can extinguish the fire before damage is caused. To further minimize the occurrence of fire, you should make sure the ventilation hoods are cleaned on a frequent basis.</p>\r\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/h-img-hvac-makeupair.jpg\" alt=\"hvac make up air unit | Hood Builder | Denver Colorado\" width=\"945\" height=\"500\" class=\"wp-image-847 size-full aligncenter\" />\r\n<h2>Restaurant Kitchen HVAC System Maintenance</h2>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The HVAC system of your restaurant kitchen needs maintenance regularly. If you ignore it, you can expose your appliances and equipment to potential damage while also putting the safety and comfort of your employees and customers at risk. Therefore, you should always keep a close watch on even minor issues and keep your HVAC system free from faults and errors by giving it the necessary maintenance on a regular basis. Most importantly, you should prepare your HVAC system for the best output when the season changes from winter to summer.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some key steps that should be followed to keep the HVAC system fully functional and avoid catastrophic problems:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Mechanical Inspection</h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First of all, the HVAC system requires an external inspection. Harsh weather conditions can impact the functioning of the mechanical equipment by damaging one or more of its components. Look for signs of damage in the HVAC cabinet, the condenser coils, and the evaporator coils. See if your air conditioning unit has refrigerant leaks and if the airflow is uniform. The coils and filters of the system need frequent cleaning to keep the HVAC system working to its maximum potential.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Electrical Service Panel Inspection</h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A damaged or worn out wire in the electrical service panel can also cause potential damage to the equipment. Before you start the electrical check, make sure the power has been turned off. It is advisable that you get the electrical service panel inspection done by a professional HVAC contractor. A skilled technician will perform the task using protective equipment. The technician will give the electrical service disconnect a good, thorough check and find out if all the connections are in good shape or need repair. Likewise, the technician will inspect every crucial component of the electrical service panel including the fuse and breakers, and repair the faults before it takes a toll on your HVAC system and other equipment.</p>\r\n<b>Ventilation Check</b>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure proper ventilation, you should check if the outside air filters are doing their job effectively. If the air filters have accumulated dirt, clean them to improve ventilation, and have the HVAC system working efficiently. Unclean air filters strain the HVAC system to work harder to eliminate the heat. This doesn’t only increase your energy bills but also paves the path to an untimely failure of the system. By cleaning the air filters, you can enhance ventilation, maintain the efficiency of the HVAC system, and avoid health risks to your employees and customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Economizer Inspection</h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many modern-day HVAC systems also feature an economizer section, which is there to benefit from free cooling. Depending on the outside weather, the economizer can bring down mechanical cooling to a significant percentage. If you want to reduce the strain on the system and use the cool weather outside to help with cooling inside the restaurant kitchen, you should make sure that each component of the economizer section is well-lubricated and working properly. By taking good care of the economizer, you can cut down your energy costs.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping the HVAC system well-maintained is crucial to the success of your restaurant business. If you plan to not let minor issues turn into major problems, you should have the system inspected on a timely basis. Seek the services of an experienced HVAC system contractor for a regular inspection. This is a highly recommended step that you can take to avoid expensive repairs, reduce energy costs, and create a comfortable atmosphere for your employees and customers.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Restaurant Kitchen HVAC System: Repair vs Replacement</h2>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An HVAC system that doesn’t function properly needs an inspection without any delay. While you can have an HVAC contractor fix the issues at hand, it’s important to know whether you actually need a repair or a replacement. Just getting a repair whereas what you actually need is a new HVAC system can lead to more problems in the future and increase your energy bills as well.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s what you need to know to make a well-informed decision:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you face heating and cooling problems with your HVAC system on a frequent basis, it is because the furnace and the air conditioner are too old. If they are 10-15 years old or more, it’s better to go for a new HVAC system than to get it repaired for quick fixes.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the repair and maintenance are unable to bring down the energy bills and you end up paying more every month, you should definitely replace your existing HVAC system with a new one.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your Restaurant Kitchen HVAC System has been repaired too many times in the past and still you can’t have the desired indoor comfort, you may want to invest in a new HVAC system for your restaurant kitchen.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you see that the cost of repair is too high and there can be more repairs required in the future, it’s a good idea to go ahead and get a brand-new HVAC system installed.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The HVAC system is made up of various components, each of which needs to function smoothly for maximum indoor comfort. If the contactors, the compressor, or the filters don’t work properly, you can get them repaired. Regular maintenance is essential to prolong the working life of your restaurant's HVAC system. But you should always think carefully and consider the total cost of repairs. If repairs are frequent and yet the HVAC system doesn’t seem to function efficiently, you should decide to replace the existing system with a new one.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Always Work with the Right HVAC System Contractor</h2>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you need HVAC maintenance, repair, or replacement, always choose to work with a professional contractor. A contractor who knows his job too well will plan the project in an effective manner, leave no margin for error, and make sure everything is done properly and on time.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;",

    "post_content": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Restaurants all over Denver are experiencing a growing problem finding reputable ventilation hood cleaning services. With Denver growing in size every year, the restaurants around town have no trouble finding hungry citizens to fill their dining rooms, but more patrons may spell trouble for the kitchen areas of those establishments. The more business these Denver eateries experience, the dirtier the vent hoods become in the kitchen. This makes the establishment more susceptible to <a href=\"/services/general-contracting/grease-trap/\">grease buildup</a>, indoor smoke pollution, and dangerous fire. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help Denver restaurants keep the grease buildup to a minimum, cleanse the air for a more appealing dining atmosphere, and prevent grease fires, it helps to find an all-in-one kitchen vent hood cleaning company. Only a company that provides full-scale restaurant hood cleaning can provide much-needed cleaning, maintenance, and repair services. These services are efficient and cost-friendly for restaurant owners, and these companies can do it all, from hood service and cleaning to hood fan installations, range hood replacement, and range hood repairs.</span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Keep Grease Buildup to a Minimum </b></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commercial kitchens produce grease and lots of it. All of this grease is typically siphoned away from hot equipment, fires, and food by way of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grease_duct\">grease traps</a>. However, even with a proper vent hood ventilation system, your restaurant could still experience caked-up grease. Too much grease presents a fire hazard, which means that grease buildup prevention should be a top priority of all kitchen managers and restaurant owners.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Denver restaurants that want to keep grease to the absolute minimum should invest in an all-in-one vent hood cleaning solution. Only a complete and professional vent hood company can prevent grease buildup with the proper cleaning equipment and techniques. In other words, the do-it-yourself approach may not cut it, as grease is sometimes impervious to many typical cleaners. A professional service will have the means to clean grease from those hard-to-reach places, such as exhaust fan mechanisms, ductwork, and other areas throughout the ventilation hood system.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Keep the Restaurant Atmosphere Appealing for Customers &amp; Staff</b></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When grease is allowed to buildup and you fail to keep your exhaust hood fan free of buildup, smoke can result. This smokiness can not only affect the food your kitchen staff prepares on a daily basis, but the kitchen atmosphere can become arid and stale, making it difficult for staff to breathe. If that smokiness drifts into your restaurant’s various food serving areas, you can probably expect your customers to choose elsewhere for their dining needs. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An all-in-one kitchen hood cleaning services will keep the atmosphere of your kitchen and dining rooms safe and presentable for staff and customers alike. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Prevent Dangerous Commercial Kitchen Fires </b></h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most important aspect of restaurant hood cleaning is preventing fires from breaking out. A commercial kitchen provides many opportunities for fire to erupt. Hot stoves and ovens along with the buildup of grease can make a situation dangerous for staff and customers. A grease fire, if left to burn, can also force a restaurant to close until all the smoke and fire damage are cleaned, repaired, and made ready for patronage once more. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A full-service commercial kitchen hood cleaning company can ensure all exhaust fans, ventilation hoods, and fire suppression systems are in perfect working order. A ventilation hood company’s primary objective is to keep a restaurant free of fire. That means that Denver area restaurant owners who are fearful of fires disrupting or shuttering their business completely should invest in a commercial kitchen hood company that can do everything under one roof.</span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Vent Hood Cleaning Process</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to save money, many Denver restaurant owners decide to let the staff clean the vent hoods and accompanying equipment, like exhaust fans. This is a mistake for several reasons. For one, restaurant staff may be too tired at the end of a busy shift to clean the vent hood systems properly. To prevent grease buildup and fires, and to keep the air inside the restaurant clean and breathable, only a professional can provide the level of cleaning that will make the kitchen safe and code compliant. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kitchen staff, for instance, simply don’t have the equipment to get deep inside the exhaust fan components to get rid of grease that could otherwise start a fire. A professional ventilation hood service has deep cleaning materials and techniques that make quick work of even the heaviest grease buildups. Therefore, if Denver area restaurant owners want to keep maintenance and repairs to a minimum while also keeping their vent hoods as clean as possible, there’s only one solution: Hire an all-in-one ventilation hood service. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is how a professional service will differ from a staff clean-up job to keep your restaurant safe and the air clean for years to come.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">●Exhaust Fan System Inspection</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first job of a full-service ventilation hood services company is to inspect the exhaust system. This helps the professionals identify anything unusual that might need to be addressed. During this <a href=\"/services/grease-interceptor/\">inspection</a>, the vent hood cleaner might notice parts that should be repaired or replaced. A common example of a part that is frequently replaced is a baffle filter.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>●Turn Off Exhaust Fans</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order to clean your vent hoods properly, the exhaust hood fan systems will need to be shut off. This prevents the cleaning staff from getting injured while also preventing damage to any commercial kitchen hood cleaning equipment. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Staff may forget to shut off all range hood fans, which can cause injury and damage to equipment, among other calamities.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">●Prepare for Commercial Hood Cleaning</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process of properly cleaning a ventilation range hood can get extremely messy. The ventilation hood cleaning technicians will begin this process by first removing the baffle filters. Then, they will prepare the hood funnels by collecting any built-up grease and debris. The powerful cleaners used on this type of build-up are strong enough to eliminate grease while also remaining safe for any food preparation areas. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before hood cleaning can begin, all nearby appliances and the floor will be covered to prevent any funnel failures or grease splatters during the cleaning process.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>●</b> Pilot Lights and Gas Valves Are Turned Off</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before any appliances are covered with tarps, all pilot lights and gas valves will be turned off. This is a very important step that might also be missed by restaurant staff during the ventilation hood cleaning process. A full-service cleaning service will only hire trained and experienced commercial kitchen hood cleaning technicians that know the importance of turning off all pilot lights and gas valves, so you can remain confident that this step will never be missed.</span><b></b></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>●The Vent Hood Cleaning Process Begins</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In most cases, you’ll find commercial hood cleaning technicians working in pairs. Typically, one technician will remain on the roof of the restaurant while the other remains in the kitchen area. The roof-based vent hood cleaner will spray all the components of the exhaust fan, ducts, and other equipment with a commercial grade degreaser. Then, the entire vent hood exhaust fan system is sprayed down with hot water. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Down in the kitchen, the other commercial kitchen cleaner makes sure that the grease and debris that are flowing down the funnel into the collection receptacle remains tidy enough to collect. The kitchen-area tech will also clean the baffle filters of the exhaust hood with a degreaser before flushing with hot water.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><b> ● </b>All Problem Areas Are Scraped</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If any grease and debris is left behind, it will have to be manually scraped, then sprayed with a chemical degreaser before it’s rinsed with hot water. This step will then be repeated until all grease and debris are gone. This is a step kitchen staff may never get to, as they may not have the equipment or patience to eliminate the last remnants of grease and dirt that can cause smoky air or fire.</span><b></b></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>● The Kitchen Vent Hoods Are Thoroughly Cleaned</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the roof cleaning complete, the technicians will start working in tandem in the kitchen. For this process, the exhaust hoods are cleaned from the bottom up, with a chemical degreaser used along with hot water. This process is also repeated until the vent hood cleaning process is thoroughly complete.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>● </b>The Hoods are Polished and Filters Reinstalled</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once all the grease and debris have been removed, the all-in-one commercial ventilation hood cleaners will dry the hoods and polish the interiors and exteriors of the entire system. Then, all baffle filters will be placed back inside the hoods and thoroughly tested to make sure they’re working properly.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>● The Certification Sticker is Applied</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This step is very important and is required by law. Once your vent hoods are completely cleaned, the technician will put a sticker on the hood, which is required by fire inspectors and the health department. Even your insurance agent might require a vent hood cleaning sticker. The sticker will list the date of cleaning and the date of the next scheduled cleaning to keep you on track.</span><b></b></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>● Kitchen Cleanup</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the vent hoods and exhaust fan systems scrubbed of all grease and debris, the vent hood specialists will clean any splattered grease from the floors or kitchen equipment. At this time, exhaust fans and pilot lights and gas valves can be switched back on. The best part is that many <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitchen_exhaust_cleaning\">exhaust fan cleaning</a> specialists will leave your kitchen in a better condition than when they arrived. </span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Importance of Restaurant Vent Hood Cleaning &amp; Maintenance</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Restaurants throughout Denver that want to keep their kitchens spotless should definitely invest in vent hood cleaning, but what about proper maintenance? Only a full-service vent hood company can make sure that all equipment is properly serviced during each cleaning appointment. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you only hire a cleaning service, you never know if those technicians might come across a malfunctioning part that they might then skip over. It’s only when that part breaks down later that you realize how expensive it is to hire a cleaning service only.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An all-in-one ventilation hood cleaning company can service your equipment, maintain it when necessary, and keep your costs to a minimum while improving your restaurant’s atmosphere and keeping it spotless as can be. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Vent Hood Repairs &amp; Equipment Replacement</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like proper maintenance is important, you need to ensure that your ventilation hoods are always repaired when it’s required. Exhaust fans that aren’t repaired and replaced on a regular basis can run inefficiently. This can also cause a smoke buildup in the kitchen and dining room areas, while also making your kitchen more susceptible to fire. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A full-service commercial ventilation cleaning, maintenance, and repair service can fix or replace parts whenever you need them. Many of these technicians keep parts on hand, and you can bet that they’ll use the very best parts available. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In short, if you operate a restaurant in and around Denver and you want to keep your costs low, staff morale high, and customers constantly choosing you for their dining needs, it pays to use an all-in-one ventilation hood cleaning services that can get every job done in a single service call.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">Signs You Require an All-in-One Vent Hood Cleaning Specialist</h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your ventilation hoods are caked with grease, it might be high-time for a full-service vent hood cleaning call. Likewise, if your exhaust fans aren’t running as they should, if you’ve never had a service technician clean the grease from your roof, or if you only allow staff to clean your ventilation hoods, it might be time to change tactics. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead, call a full-service commercial ventilation hood cleaning services in Denver, Colorado, like Hood Builder, for all your vent hood and exhaust fan cleaning, maintenance, and service needs. Once you see how much you can save and how efficient our services are, you’ll likely wonder why you never called sooner. </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our vent hood specialists are standing by. As a ventilation hood cleaning services leader, we are the company to call when you want a clean, safe, and customer-friendly Denver food establishment. </span></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;",

    "post_content": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400; margin-bottom: 25px;\">When considering the design, construction, or remodel of your ideal restaurant, you need to take care that everything goes according to plan. The last thing you want to do is complete the job only to find out that you’re disappointed with the work.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The goal of any restaurant is to draw in the local crowd for a mouthwatering bite and fun in a relaxed atmosphere. Whether you’re going for a family restaurant design, new bar construction, or a restaurant and bar remodel, you have much to consider.</p>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following list can help.</span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 30px !important;\">10 Important Points to Consider When Designing, Constructing, or Remodeling the Ideal Restaurant</h2>\r\n<h3>You Must Obtain the Necessary Restaurant Permits</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you plan to design and construct a new restaurant or remodel a turnkey situation, you will need to acquire the proper building permits. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The permits you require will depend on the city where your restaurant will be located, along with other factors, such as when you plan to transform an office building into a restaurant, for example. Getting the proper codes and filling them out correctly can be a complex affair. Ensure you get the help of a professional so that your restaurant design, construction, or <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/remodeling/\">remodel</a> remains code-compliant.</span>\r\n<h3>Everything Must Be Planned Carefully</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/construction/\">restaurant’s design and construction</a> or complete remodel will need to be planned from the top down. Every detail must be included, as you never want to back yourself into a corner or get to the middle of construction only to find that you have an expensive roadblock that throws your restaurant construction crew off track.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your entire operation, from the front of the house and back of the house to your seating and even your decorations, should be planned out well in advance. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with restaurant design and remodel planning, you will want to tick off all the boxes that go with opening a new restaurant, including obtaining a liquor license, securing food and beverage vendors, restaurant furniture suppliers, and restaurant equipment suppliers, among others. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Failing to plan properly can lead to a halt to production, which will drown out your dreams of business ownership before your new restaurant even has a chance to open.</span>\r\n<h3>Open Sunlight and Ventilation</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Few people want to eat a meal in a dark room. For that reason, ensure that your restaurant design blueprint includes plans for an open and spacious dining room. With lots of windows and plenty of natural sunlight, your environment will seem more open and inviting, which is always good for the restaurant business.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should also plan to obtain the necessary ventilation systems to keep your air pure and your kitchen free of soot, smoke, and carcinogenic pollutants. With ventilation hoods, fans, HVAC, and make-up systems working together, you can ensure clean and easy breathing for your staff and customers.</span>\r\n<h3>Fire Safety Considerations</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whenever there are heat and grease, fire can result. This makes restaurant kitchens literal hotbeds for the breakout of a dangerous fire. To keep the fire from damaging your restaurant design or remodel, ensure that you have the proper fire prevention equipment in place. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A sprinkler system or chemical fire suppression system can be enough to eliminate most types of fire, including electrical and grease fires. Ensure that you have the proper systems in place for the types of fire your kitchen is most at risk for. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, you will want to ensure that all of your staff are trained and have access to Class K fire extinguishers. You can ensure that a fire extinguisher is always close at hand by placing them at strategic points throughout your restaurant design or remodel blueprint. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In case a tragic fire does break out, you will want to ensure there are clearly-marked exits and that those exits are brightly lit so that customers and staff can always see them, even when visibility is low due to smoke and soot. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The local fire inspector can ensure your restaurant plan is code-compliant for safety and the protection of your new restaurant design or remodel.</span>\r\n<h3>Back of House Should Be Safe and Efficient</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When designing your kitchen, ensure that your equipment works together to keep everything functional and efficient. This is going to require a lot of planning and homework on your part. The type of kitchen you design will depend on the kinds of meals you plan to prepare and the layout that you want.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When designing the ideal kitchen for a new restaurant design and construction, or restaurant remodel, make sure you have room for a cleaning and washing station, food storage and preparation areas, meal cooking appliances, and service areas for your line runners and wait staff.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help you design or remodel a restaurant kitchen that is near intuitive for staff, it might help to borrow from a proven commercial kitchen design layout. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can then customize the layout to fit your exact needs.</span>\r\n<h3>Don’t Forget About Parking</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your restaurant is not the only thing you have to consider when engaging in a new design or remodel. Your parking lot is critically important to the success of your business. Without adequate parking, customers might feel compelled to give a competitor a chance the next time they’re hungry. If you can manage to create a safe and spacious parking lot that has enough parking to accommodate your seating, you’ll contribute to the success of your business.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your parking lot will need to be lined with the appropriate signage in order to remain legally and code compliant.</span>\r\n<h3>Wheelchair Accessible Parking and Seating</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are required by law to make your restaurant wheelchair accessible, both in the parking lot and at your front entrances. You will also need handicapped parking signs and the appropriate parking lot markings to ensure your restaurant is open and inviting to everyone, the able-bodied and disabled alike.</span>\r\n<h3>Seating That is Fire Code Compliant</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your local fire inspector can let you know how many people can be seated in your restaurant safely in order to remain fire code compliant. The number of patrons you are provided with cannot be altered and you should have enough seating to accommodate that number of people only.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remaining fire code compliant ensures the safety of your customers and staff. Ask your local fire inspectors for other rules and acknowledgments that may apply to your business, depending on your restaurant size, type, and location.</span>\r\n<h3>Calculate Site Analysis, Budget, Strategy</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The actual design or remodel of your restaurant gives you much to consider, but you’re not done yet; not by a long shot. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now comes the time to calculate the cost of your restaurant construction, the timetable, and a strategy for completing your restaurant on-budget, on-time, and with no or minimal disruption to your production team.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Completing a budget and cost analysis is also going to require a lot of homework on your end. You’ll need to accommodate for the building mortgage or rent, equipment rentals and purchases to make construction possible, kitchen equipment purchases to stock your kitchen, chairs, and tables to accommodate your seating requirements, HVAC systems, gas and electrical service, lighting, ballasts, and more. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your restaurant design or remodel construction plan will then need to keep on schedule in order to use your budget effectively. If you can, try to assess any risks to production before they occur. Examples might include weather delays, bureaucratic red tape that must be overcome, restaurant construction equipment failure, and vendor delivery delays.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even one of these instances can cause your restaurant design or remodel to bleed money until construction can resume once more. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, you’ll want to have a construction manager on-hand to direct production and to ensure that everything goes according to plan.</span>\r\n<h3>For a Fast &amp; Efficient Design/Build or Remodel, Hire the Experts</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When envisioning the perfect restaurant design or remodel, you have a ton to consider, this much you now know. You have to secure the building and proper permits, draw up the proper blueprints, design your front and back of the house for maximum efficiency, plan your parking and seating, install the necessary fire suppression equipment, and set up relationships with vendors, construction materials suppliers, and more.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 30px !important;\">Instead of burning yourself out before your restaurant even opens with too many details, why not leave the restaurant design, construction, or remodel to the experts?</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you find a company that is experienced with the type of restaurant you plan to open, you know that the cards are already dealt in your favor. Every detail will be planned, including your layout, seating, kitchen efficiency, and fire suppression. When a company has an actual checklist that it works through when dealing with clients, you know that no stone will be left unturned. Your restaurant design or remodel will be constructed exactly as planned while adhering to all budget and scheduling constraints.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A company that designs, constructs, and remodels restaurants like the one you have in mind will typically already have relationships with vendors and suppliers. The organization will know how to obtain the proper building permits and how to fill them out so that your restaurant is completely covered. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company will also have floorplans you can choose from so they can be customized for your needs. From furniture and entry doors to the construction materials used in your dining rooms, you will have total say in all that goes on. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only difference is that the company will direct the planning and the strategy for getting your restaurant constructed or remodeled. A company like that will have planned for operational delays well in advance so that you can keep to your budget and schedule, all while designing your perfect restaurant. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want a restaurant you can be proud of, the best choice might be to find a local restaurant construction builder who has the methods, relationships, and manpower to get the job done.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><b>Conclusion </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who knew that opening a new restaurant or remodeling a turnkey operation could involve so much? </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because there is so much to consider, you can see why proper restaurant design and construction require so much planning. Everything must be pre-planned far in advance to keep operations going and costs to a minimum. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By having a skilled, trained, and experienced restaurant construction team on your side through it all, you can make sure your restaurant opens its doors just in time for opening day.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 30px !important;\">Call Hood Builder for a Customized Restaurant Design Quote</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hood Builder is the restaurant design, construction, and remodeling leader in the areas throughout Denver, Colorado.

    "post_content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a restaurant first opens, everything is usually polished to a bright sheen. Every item is in its place, and the environment is perfectly decorated to provide the most memorable customer experience. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet, it won’t take long for your restaurant to require deep cleaning, even with only moderate customer traffic. A deep clean should begin at the front of the house and move all the way to the back, making sure all the areas in between are equally spotless. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Restaurant cleaning is not a light job, as food preparation, dining, and serving can create quite a mess in a very short period of time. All commercial kitchens have a buildup of grease and grime, which must be scrubbed away to keep the kitchen clean, food prep areas sanitary, and to prevent the outbreak of dangerous and deadly fire. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commercial kitchen cleaning is only one aspect of restaurant cleaning, however. Janitorial services will keep your dining and office areas clean and organized while floor cleaning and maintenance will make your restaurant safe and presentable for loyal and future customers alike. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can pass this job off to your restaurant staff but doing so is not recommended. Only professional restaurant cleaning crews have the proper training, equipment, and experience to get your eatery in tip-top condition by the time of your next opening. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A cleaning crew will take pride in the details, giving you the clean restaurant you expect and an establishment that always passes its inspections while pleasing its customers day after day.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the ins and outs of restaurant cleaning so that you know what to expect when hiring the restaurant cleaning crew of your choice. </span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>Gather the Proper Tools and Equipment </b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A quality cleaning crew will show up at your restaurant with a truckload of chemicals, tools, and other items for a proper restaurant scrub-down. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cleaning solutions the crew might arrive with include bleach, window cleaner, Comet floor cleaner, powdered soap, and upholstery cleaning solution, as well as wood oil polish. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of the equipment restaurant cleaning crews have been known to use include brooms, mops, nylon scrubbers, spray bottles, sponges, squeegees, toilet brushes, and steel wool scrubbers.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Air Ducts and HVAC </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A major aspect of keeping your restaurant clean is to maintain a breathable and healthy air supply. With heavy use, your restaurant’s air ducts, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems can become caked with grease and debris. This only serves to contaminate the air your staff and customers breathe. All those odors, dust, and contaminants will be circulated in and out of your dining and commercial kitchen areas, depleting customer enjoyment, and leading to a greater risk of a health violation. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proper commercial duct and HVAC cleaning services can restore your equipment to peak efficiency. A thorough cleaning of all ducts and components will also eliminate offensive odors and reduce the growth of unhealthy mold.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In conclusion, just because your ducts and HVAC system may be tucked away and out of sight doesn’t mean those components can’t harm your restaurant if left to get dusty and dirty. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Restaurant cleaning can save you in energy costs, cut down on odors, and lead to a cleaner restaurant with healthier and breathable air. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Carpet and Upholstery  </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like most restaurant owners, you spent a lot of time selecting the ideal carpeting and upholstery to bring all your décor together. You can protect your investment with carpeting and upholstery cleaning by professional restaurant cleaners. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One significant reason why this job shouldn’t be left up to your staff is that carpeting and upholstery come in a variety of materials and textures. The wrong cleaner can ruin a patch of carpet or permanently damage a section of your upholstery. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A professional cleaning crew will have the cleaning solutions and equipment to work on a wide variety of today’s most popular carpet and upholstery materials. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many cleaning crews offer specific methods, such as bonnet cleaning for short piled carpets, hot water extraction for a deeper clean, deluxe conditioning and rinse for heavily soiled areas, and dry cleaning when color-fastness may be an issue.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The carpeting in your restaurant acts as a filter that traps dust, dirt, animal hair, and other soils. With vacuuming and spot removal, along with the services previously mentioned, you can have carpeting that looks just as good as the day you laid it down.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The quality of your upholstery is important for making your restaurant look presentable and welcoming enough to entice customers to enter, sit, and eat. Professional upholstery cleaning with the proper solutions and equipment will ensure your restaurant is always dressed to impress. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Floors, Ceilings &amp; Walls </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A restaurant cleaning crew will know how to get your floors sparkling, no matter how much foot traffic they’ve experienced. When it comes to your ceilings and walls, these areas can attract all sorts of debris and contaminants like dirt, dust, cooking oils, grease, and more. Don’t blame your customers and staff for your dirty ceilings and walls, as your <a href=\"/services/hvac/\">HVAC system</a> can distribute these contaminants all throughout your restaurant. That’s why it’s important to pair HVAC cleaning with the floor, ceiling, and wall cleaning so your restaurant looks and smells wonderful for the very best customer experience. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Drapes &amp; Blinds </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to carpet and upholstery, your restaurant may be furnished with drapes and blinds that come in a variety of colors and materials. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A professional restaurant cleaning service will thoroughly inspect each set of drapes and blinds to determine how they can be cleaned. Before cleaning can begin, the crew will usually test a tiny area to see if color-fastness occurs. This is the same process used on carpeting and upholstery to maintain quality while the cleaning process is ongoing. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your drapes and blinds are cleaned properly, they will be free of visible dirt and debris, helping your windows stand out while giving your restaurant a polished appearance. </span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>Commercial Kitchen Cleaning </b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While your staff, serving, and dining areas may get a tad messy, the real dirty work is conducted in your average commercial kitchen. Food preparation coupled with grease, oil, and high heat can produce all kinds of debris and contaminants. If left to get dirtier, all that grease, oil, and debris can circulate throughout your restaurant, coat the walls, and lead to odors, bad air, and even fire. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A commercial restaurant cleaning crew will begin cleaning your kitchen on the roof, in many cases. All grease, oil, and debris that is trapped in your HVAC system and vents will need to be flushed out completely using high-pressure water tools. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Down in the kitchen, the crew will be busy covering all the cooking and food preparation areas. Doing so prevents those appliances and surfaces from getting splashed by the dirty water flowing down from the roof. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the vents and HVAC system have been cleaned, the crew will begin with the commercial kitchen cleaning project itself. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many commercial kitchens contain stainless steel appliances and cooking surfaces. These may include stoves and ovens, <a href=\"/services/general-contracting/grease-trap/\">grease traps</a> and ventilation hoods, fans, and refrigerators, just to name a few. All of this stainless-steel equipment must be thoroughly scraped with special tools so that the surfaces are free of oil and grease buildup. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ventilation hoods, fans, and other equipment that are designed to exhaust heat, smoke, grease, and debris must also be cleaned. These items take more time since they contain the tiniest of parts. In some cases, fans and vent hoods will be disassembled for a deeper clean, and to repair or replace parts as necessary.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with scraping, a heavy-duty degreasing solution will be used on all appliances and surfaces. When the restaurant cleaning crew is finished, all of the appliances will be non-slick to the touch with a fresh and presentable shine. </span>\r\n<h2><b>Grease Trap Cleaning &amp; Grease Removal </b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cleaning the appliances is only one aspect of commercial kitchen cleaning. Of course, the floors, walls, and ceilings will be cleaned to prevent the buildup of oil, grease, and debris; but the grease trap itself must also be cleaned.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grease_duct\">grease trap</a> helps a commercial kitchen trap grease, oil, and other solids from entering the septic tank and sewer lines. When grease, oil, and all those other food particles harden, they can overtax and even break your septic system or clog your sewer, leading to a stinky backup. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many commercial kitchen cleaning crews will even haul away your excess grease so that it can be disposed of properly. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keeping your grease trap clean can save you money and keep you from closing down in case the sewer ever backs up. That is why it is critical that you get the help of a professional kitchen cleaning service that knows how to remove tough grease and grime in any quantity for safe, affordable, and inspection-passing results. </span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>Septic &amp; Sewage Backup Cleaning </b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a thorough job, you should ensure that your septic system is free of any grease, oil, food solids, and other debris that can clog the system and cause your sewage to back up into your restaurant kitchen. Ideally, you will want to prevent a sewage backup before it occurs. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the sewer system does get clogged, all that sewage can flow upward through your pipes and into your kitchen. A severe backup can even contaminate your dining areas, with all that dirty water soaking into your carpeting and other fabrics. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Odor Removal</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A restaurant kitchen creates all sorts of odors, some good and some foul. If the restaurant has experienced a fire, sewer backup, or some other accident, more severe odors may exist. A professional commercial restaurant and kitchen cleaning service can remove all of those odors completely. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using powerful cleaners and equipment, such as steam and high-pressure cleaning tools, your restaurant can be scrubbed of any smells that may keep customers away. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your restaurant will then be deodorized with ozone purifiers until there is no evidence that any accident occurred at all.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Vandalism </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting your restaurant tagged by vandals can be a disheartening experience. You shouldn’t have to close your business down just because your establishment has become a target for troublemakers. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A professional restaurant cleaning service can deliver the solutions and tools to remove spray paint, repair damage to your drapes, carpet, and upholstery, and repaint your walls to restore your restaurant to pre-vandalized conditions. </span>\r\n<h2><b>Maintaining a Regular Commercial Restaurant Cleaning Schedule </b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s a mistake to wait until your restaurant smells bad or looks shabby before calling a professional cleaning crew. Restaurant owners who want to maintain a clean, presentable, and safe environment for customers and staff all year round know that regular cleaning is key.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A professional cleaning service can put you on a maintenance and cleaning schedule that works with your restaurant’s normal operating hours. The cleaning crew can show up at night and finish by the time you open the next day. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For restaurants that operate 24-hours a day, seven days a week, the cleaning crew can work during the times that are slowest. The crew can also work with minimal disturbance to your staff and customers, ensuring that your restaurant gets cleaned in the background for a discreet and thorough job. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Get Professional Restaurant Cleaning in Denver, Colorado</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When a person walks into your restaurant for the first time, you can bet that they’ll immediately start taking things in. Your doorway and entryway should be clean and presentable, and your air should be scrubbed so that only pleasant odors fill the dining area. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your upholstery should be clean enough to sit on, and your kitchen should be free of grease, oil, and other debris. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want that kind of restaurant that customers love to visit, contact Hood Builder for professional commercial restaurant and kitchen cleaning.

    "post_content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a business owner, you should be investing in commercial grease trap cleaning services if you want your restaurant to grow while keeping your investment intact.  </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All high-volume restaurants have to contend with heavy amounts of grease on a daily basis. Grease interceptors, otherwise known as grease traps, act very much the same way septic tanks work in our homes. With a residential septic tank, solid waste is separated from wastewater so that the latter can flow unhindered into the sewer system. Without the ability to separate solid from liquid, our sewers would quickly become clogged, leading to a gigantic and expensive mess. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A restaurant grease trap works the same way. As the food is being prepared, a grease trap separates liquid oil from solid fats, oil, and grease (FOG) particles, allowing the liquid grease to be “trapped” in a special receptacle. That is the grease interceptor or grease trap that will eventually need to be emptied and cleaned. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you attempt to have your staff do the dirty work, you should know that only a restaurant grease trap cleaning service can give you the protection you deserve. </span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"font-size: 40px !important;\">Protection from what, you may ask?</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For one, by cleaning your grease traps properly, you will prevent the outbreak of fire. A grease fire is not easily controlled unless you have a cutting-edge wet-chemical fire suppression system on hand. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another risk is a sewer backup, which can quickly push customers away.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ideally, you’ll want to prevent a fire or sewer backup before they have a chance to occur. You can do so by having your <a href=\"/services/general-contracting/grease-trap/\">grease traps cleaned</a> by professionals with training, experience, and the proper equipment to get the job done.</span>\r\n<h2>How is a Grease Trap Cleaned?</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many restaurants today employ passive grease traps, which means that grease and solid particles flow into the trap, whereby the two will be separated before being trapped in separate containers. Your grease trap holds the solids that have been removed while the wastewater flows into the sewers. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grease traps are metal or plastic reservoirs that prevent FOG from entering the sanitary sewer or septic system. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grease interceptors are large, in-ground outdoor tanks that prevent FOG and food particles from entering your restaurant’s septic system or the local sewer line. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To clean the grease trap, the cover will have to be removed before grease trap pumping occurs. Pumping the grease from the trap requires the use of heavy-duty trucks and industrial hose to funnel the grease away so it can be disposed of properly. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The entire system will then be dismantled, degreased with powerful agents, and polished to a sheen to prevent future grease buildup. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These procedures can take time, and careful attention-to-detail will need to be used. That is because, aside from cleaning, a professional service will be able to identify issues before they become serious problems, along with repairs in case there are cracks or other defects that can affect your grease trap’s performance. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doing the cleanup job yourself or giving it to your staff only leaves you open to future and expensive problems. If and when those problems occur, you’ll likely end up calling a commercial grease trap cleaning service to do the job right.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make the right decision the first time around and select a commercial company near you with the personnel and equipment you can trust. </span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>How Often Should Cleaning Be Performed?</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In order for your grease trap to function as it should, it is recommended that you keep a deep layer of water inside. Only when food layers and grease comprise 25% or more of the trap’s inner space should cleaning be performed. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A professional cleaning service will have the expertise to clean your trap and all accompanying systems based on your volume and type of food prepared. If your business serves lots of sauces and dressing, leading to more oil and fat buildup, you may require more frequent grease trap cleaning. That’s just one example of how professionals can help you stay on top of grease trap emptying, cleaning, maintenance and repairs. </span>\r\n<h2>It Pays to Find a Commercial Grade Cleaning Service</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The septic tank was invented over 100 years ago and to this day remains a restaurant’s primary defense against deadly fire, among other issues. To keep your grease trap clean, you should be selecting among the best and most local services available to you. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here is what you should look for when searching through the various grease trap cleaning services in your area.</span>\r\n<h2>10 Attributes to Look for Searching for Commercial Grease Trap Cleaning Services</h2>\r\n<ul class=\"blgoListTitle\"><li style=\"font-size: 30px !important;\"><h3 style=\"display: inline-block!important\">Experienced with Your Type of Equipment</h3></li></ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find a professional cleaning service that has hands-on experience with your exact model of a grease trap. You should know that grease traps come in a series of specific makes and models, including small passive hydromechanical <a href=\"/services/grease-interceptor/\">grease interceptors</a> (HGI), gravity grease interceptors (GGI), automatic grease and oil recovery systems, and high capacity hydromechanical grease interceptors. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A service worthy of your time and money will know precisely how to clean your type of trap and will be able to dismantle and reassemble your unit with ease. This kind of industry knowledge can help you feel confident that you’ve hired the very best service professionals for the job. </span>\r\n<ul class=\"blgoListTitle\"><li style=\"font-size: 30px !important;\"><h3 style=\"display: inline-block!important\">Thorough Cleaning</h3></li></ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Only by hiring a professional service can you be certain that your entire grease trap system will be maintained and cleaned as it should be.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For best results, your grease trap will be dismantled so that the baffle and each individual component can be degreased and polished until It’s safe for use in the kitchen once more. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A commercial grease trap cleaning service won’t stop there, however. There’s grease pumping, storage and removal, floor drain cleaning, high-pressure washing, and septic tank maintenance. Only when each of these areas is given the proper attention can you be confident that dangerous fire will be kept at bay.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you find a service that comes highly recommended, you can remain confident that your septic tank will be spotless by the end of the service call. </span>\r\n<ul class=\"blgoListTitle\"><li style=\"font-size: 30px !important;\"><h3 style=\"display: inline-block!important\">Careful Attention to Detail</h3></li></ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commercial grease trap cleaning professionals will take the time to clean and scrape the grease to prevent future buildup. On a typical busy day, your commercial kitchen likely produces a variety of contaminants that can hide in the unlikeliest of places. All the nooks and crannies of your grease trap will need to be scrubbed until spotless, and that’s a commercial-grade service’s expertise. </span>\r\n<ul class=\"blgoListTitle\"><li style=\"font-size: 30px !important;\"><h3 style=\"display: inline-block!important\">Protection from Fire</h3></li></ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s said that two out of every three restaurant fires is caused by grease, oil, and fat. These substances are normally funneled to the grease trap and kept out of harm’s way. When left to overflow, however, your grease trap can become a fire hazard. A professional service will have the heavy-duty equipment to remove all the excess grease and FOG to ensure fire code compliance. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The local fire inspector will be checking your grease traps, that much you can be sure. Be sure and call a professional cleaning service to keep your business compliant. </span>\r\n<ul class=\"blgoListTitle\"><li style=\"font-size: 30px !important;\"><h3 style=\"display: inline-block!important\">Green Solutions</h3></li></ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since you work with food, you will want to search for commercial grease trap cleaning services that have a history with emptying and cleaning the grease traps for other food service businesses. That way, you can be sure that the solutions the company uses to eradicate grease, and the processes used to store and carry grease away, are compliant with health and fire codes. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You are also encouraged to ask about the various services’ grease disposal methods to ensure they are enviro-friendly. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commercial-grade cleaning services will also use chemicals that are safe for use around food preparation areas, but do your proper diligence and ask plenty of questions when interviewing cleaners near you just to be sure. </span>\r\n<ul class=\"blgoListTitle\"><li style=\"font-size: 30px !important;\"><h3 style=\"display: inline-block!important\">Secure Grease Collection</h3></li></ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The service you select will have the necessary equipment to secure the grease so that it can be safely carried away. Grease can’t just be thrown into the sewer or dumpster, after all. If the person cleaning your grease trap doesn’t know what he or she is doing, the job could get very messy. For that reason, ensure you employ the services of commercial grease trap cleaning services, which use heavy trucks to cart your grease away safely and with no harm to the environment. </span>\r\n<ul class=\"blgoListTitle\"><li style=\"font-size: 30px !important;\"><h3 style=\"display: inline-block!important\">Professionals Can Check for Warning Signs</h3></li></ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A commercial cleaning service can put you on a regular maintenance service so that your grease traps can be cleaned and maintained as needed. Not only will this keep your restaurant health and fire code compliant, but skilled personnel will be more adept at identifying problems before they have a chance to manifest. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, a clogged grease trap is a major concern for all restaurant owners. When FOG becomes too much for the extractor system to handle, a grease clog can occur, leading to backflow. That’s as awful as it sounds. Imagine leftover grease, oil, fats, and sewage flowing into your kitchen, threatening the next day’s sales. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A commercial restaurant grease trap cleaning service will be able to identify problems like clogs, cracks, and component malfunctions before they get out of hand. </span>\r\n<ul class=\"blgoListTitle\"><li style=\"font-size: 30px !important;\"><h3 style=\"display: inline-block!important\">Higher Chances of Better Ratings</h3></li></ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your grease traps aren’t cleaned regularly and professionally, you risk the quality of your restaurant being permeated by foul odors and contaminated air. Leave your grease trap to overflow for too long and you’ll begin noticing customer complaints about the “off” smells and tastes, and quite possibly smoky air. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you take the time to sift through all local commercial grease trap cleaning services, you give your business a fighting chance at having the highest ratings in town. </span>\r\n<ul class=\"blgoListTitle\"><li style=\"font-size: 30px !important;\"><h3 style=\"display: inline-block!important\">Offer 24/7 Service</h3></li></ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you ever have an issue with your grease trap system at an inopportune moment, such as in the middle of the night, it pays to have a commercial service on call day or night. Therefore, it may benefit you to select only among those services that offer 24/7 service, just in case a backflow occurs at 2 am and you need cleanup services fast. </span>\r\n<ul class=\"blgoListTitle\"><li style=\"font-size: 30px !important;\"><h3 style=\"display: inline-block!important\">Fully-Detailed Inspection reports</h3></li></ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choosing professionals to clean your <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grease_trap\">grease trap</a> ensures that your restaurant remains code compliant. However, local inspectors don’t have to take your word for it. A professional service will provide you with certified documentation that states that your grease trap is cleaned and ready for regular use. </span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Grease Trap Maintenance Can Save You Money</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to calling a service every time your grease trap needs to be cleaned, you should be engaging in regular maintenance of your commercial kitchen unit.

    "post_content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The risk of fire is a danger that concerns all restaurant owners. According to the </span><a href=\"https://www.nfpa.org/News-and-Research/Data-research-and-tools/Building-and-Life-Safety/Eating-and-drinking-establishments\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA)</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, cooking equipment is the leading cause of many of these blazes. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sadly, less than half of all restaurants employ a state-of-the-art sprinkler or </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fire suppression system</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. This lack of proper equipment can turn dangerous if a blaze were ever to break out in your commercial kitchen. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To protect your restaurant and your investment, it’s important to get with the times. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can successfully keep grease, oil, and high heat from turning into a deadly fire by installing a cutting-edge range guard fire suppression system, which is currently one of the best systems for fire protection on the market.  </span>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\n\n<h2>What is A Range Guard Fire Suppression System?</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A </span><a href=\"/services/fire-suppression-systems/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">range guard fire suppression system</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is designed to offer maximum protection during an outbreak of fire. The moment a flame or smoke is detected, specialized nozzles will begin spraying a wet chemical suppression agent all across the affected area. The nozzles are specifically-manufactured to provide wide and total coverage, which is typically enough to extinguish the fire and prevent new fires from igniting. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is an added bonus to using a wet chemical agent as a fire suppression solution. Not only will spraying the fire put out the flame, but all the </span><a href=\"/commercial-grease-trap-cleaning-services-importance/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">grease and fat</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> left behind will be converted into soap, which in turn keeps those particles and flammable liquids from reigniting. The resulting soapy sludge can then be wiped away, leaving the floor slightly cleaner than it was before. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, not all range guards are created equal. Here are ten necessities to look for when shopping for a range guard fire suppression system to suit your needs.</span>\n<h2>10 Range Guard Must-Haves for Ultimate Fire Protection<b></b></h2>\n<h3>Flexible Piping</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You want a range guard system that can be customized to any application. All commercial kitchens have varying appliances and layouts. Flexible piping gives the system the ability to spray far and wide around the affected area, putting out the blaze and preventing new fires from flaring up. </span>\n<h3>Reliable Pressure Cylinder</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the wet chemical solution to be effective, the spray must be forceful enough to travel to the spot at the base of the fire. With such heavy pressure flowing through the range guard system, you’ll want to make sure that the pressure cylinders can take the abuse. Only trust your restaurant to manufacturers and installation experts who focus on quality first so that you get the best and most reliable fire suppression system money can buy. </span>\n<h3>Sturdy Valves</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All aspects of the range guard should be enough to hold the system in place and ensure it acts as it should. The slightest defect or malfunctioning part can throw your range guard off, leading to dangerous consequences in case an outbreak of fire does occur. Instead, look for range guards that come highly recommended and that have proven effective in restaurant fires. Doing your due diligence will have two benefits. You’ll effectively protect your investment while ensuring your range guard’s valves hold up when it counts most. </span>\n<h3>Pressure Gauges</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some range guards come with pressure gauges and others don’t. Look for ones with gauges so that you can determine when the system is charged when the system requires equipment maintenance, and when the system is malfunctioning. You’ll want to be aware of any problems with your system before a fire has a chance to break out, and pressure gauges attached to your fire suppression system nozzles will help you do just that. </span>\n<h3>Internal Strainers</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The wet chemical solution is designed to flow through the system and out through the nozzles at an incredibly rapid pace. This fast action is necessary so that the fire doesn’t burn out of control. The slightest clog or backup within your range guard fire suppression system can cost you countless seconds when every single one counts. When you only shop for range guards with internal strainers, you know you’re getting a system that has the safeguards in place to protect against clogs and backups for consistently quick fire suppression that’s ready to activate whenever needed. </span>\n<h3>Foil Bursting Discs</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foil bursting discs represent a second safeguard many of these systems have in place to prevent blockages during a wet chemical release. The discs are designed to prevent the system from over-pressurizing or otherwise malfunctioning so that you always get </span><a href=\"/services/fire-suppression-systems/installations/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">reliable fire suppression</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the moment a flame or smoke is detected. </span>\n<h3>Swivel Adapters</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All aspects of your system should be customizable, once again. You should be able to install your system where you want and have it directed at areas where fire outbreaks are most likely, such as over ovens, deep fryers, and other appliances. In other words, look for systems that are designed with your specific needs in mind.</span>\n<h3>Aesthetics</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today’s modern range guards not only act the part, but they also look the part. Range guard fire suppression systems can be designed to match your cooking equipment and other appliances, with chrome, black and other colors readily available. </span>\n<h3>Functionality</h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Look for restaurant range guards that come with excellent reviews for your peace of mind. Take your time examining the capabilities of each system so that you know you’re getting the best fire suppression on the market. Doing so will keep fire at bay while also appeasing your local fire inspector. </span>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\n\n<h2>Incorporates with Your Fire Suppression System</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A range guard fire suppression system doesn’t have to exist all on its own. The best range guards incorporate with your current fire suppression system, allowing fire alarms, sprinklers, and your range guard fire suppression to alert you to and eliminate fires the moment one breaks out. </span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t trust your fire suppression needs to anyone else. When you want the </span><a href=\"/services/fire-suppression-systems/range-guard/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">best range guards</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on the market, Hood Builder in Denver, Colorado is the company to call. </span>\n<h2>Get a Range Guard Fire Suppression System You Can Rely On</h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Hood Builder, we only offer the best, most customizable range guard fire suppression systems for your hard-earned money.

    "post_content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Restaurant Design Tips:</strong> A </span><a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/remodeling/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">restaurant tenant finish</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> can be a daunting project, especially for your very first time. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have leased the space, and now you need to bring your restaurant design concept to fruition. No pressure, right? </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure your opening day goes off as flawlessly as you imagine, keep the following considerations in mind as you complete the restaurant tenant finish project. You will also find a series of tips for designing your restaurant build-out exactly as you prefer. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Opening day will be here before you know it. Follow this advice, and your customers are sure to enjoy your establishment’s unveiling.</span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Electricity</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be aware that </span><a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/construction/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">new restaurant construction</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> might require you to upgrade the building’s electrical system. Have the electrical power source checked and all internal wiring tested by a qualified electrician before beginning the restaurant tenant finish process. Your landlord will be responsible for keeping the electricity is up to code. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition, check all equipment to ensure optimal power. This includes walk-in coolers, range hood fans, and other components that could cost you at the meter if those parts ever turn faulty. You may need to </span><a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/equipment/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">upgrade your equipment</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> if you do identify efficiency issues, which can add to your restaurant construction costs. </span>\r\n<h2>Ventilation &amp; Air Quality</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like most restaurants, your <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heating,_ventilation,_and_air_conditioning\">ventilation system</a> is likely to take a significant bite out of your restaurant construction budget. However, a proper HVAC system is necessary to keep your air quality pure and your commercial establishment up to code. In addition to heating and air-conditioning, you will also need proper </span><a href=\"/services/hvac/ventilation/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ventilation in the kitchen</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Federal and local fire codes require you to keep vent hoods over all stoves, grills, and deep fryers. These hoods should have adequate fans to direct smoke and heat away from grease and oil. The hoods also trap grease to keep the fire at bay. If you have any appliances that use oil, you should have a vent hood and a fire suppression system over those components. </span>\r\n<h2>General Construction Services</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure a quality final project, spend time looking for a highly-referred </span><a href=\"/about-us/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">restaurant construction company</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that will put attention-to-detail into your restaurant’s floors, restrooms, kitchen, dining areas, business office, and staff areas. Even turnkey restaurant services may require a little upgrading, such as building ramps for those with disabilities and making doorways wide enough to accommodate wheelchairs. The best company will do the job right the first time, keeping your costs to a minimum. </span>\r\n<h2>Plumbing Should Be Top-Notch</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Never skimp on plumbing whether you are constructing a new restaurant or rebuilding an existing one. This keeps you from facing expensive backups and pipe leaks later on. In addition, you need a variety of sinks that will be used to safely prepare food and meet health department codes. A dishwasher and/or three-compartment sink is required. The three-section sink should consider a dishwashing section, a prep sink for washing produce, and a handwashing sink. A separate mop sink is also a good idea. Finally, be cognizant of your restroom facilities and bar sink, if necessary. Your layout should put your sink as close together as possible to save money on plumbing installation services.  </span>\r\n<h2>Restaurant Equipment</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A </span><a href=\"/services/general-contracting/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">turnkey restaurant construction project</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> may come with all the equipment you need to cook, bake, fry, and otherwise prepare all the tasty creations your business will become known for. Keep in mind that restaurant equipment will require regular maintenance and repair, particularly after years of busy shifts. Check all equipment during the restaurant construction or renovation process to ensure maximum output. If there is any question with regards to your equipment’s reliability, have the equipment maintained or replaced as necessary. Switching out shoddy or faulty equipment could add to your costs, but energy-efficient cooking equipment will save you dividends in the long run.</span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Restaurant Design Tips for First-Time Builders or Renovators</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the restaurant is finished, next comes the overall design. This is the aesthetic environment you hope to provide to your loyal customers. Here is how to create the most ideal restaurant aura to attract crowds of patrons for years to come. </span>\r\n<h2>Repurpose to Save On Costs</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the aesthetic you are aiming for, look for ways you can repurpose existing features, like cement floors, ceiling beams, and rustic brickwork. These elements can add a unique design quality while saving you immensely on </span><a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/design/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">restaurant design expenses</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span>\r\n\r\n<h2>Bring in the Design Experts &amp; Leave Enough Time</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Out of all commercial construction services, the design aspect can be the most complicated and time-consuming. Consider that you are bringing together the expertise of the general contractor, architect, and interior designer. With these bright minds working together, your </span><a href=\"/services/general-contracting/architectural-drawing/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">restaurant layout</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and overall design are sure to come together, as long as you leave plenty of room for complications just in case. When all is said and done, the look and feel of your restaurant are sure to please, and you are sure to find the necessary seating, ventilation, and general ambiance your customers will love. </span>\r\n<h2>Minimize Bad Table Locations</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a restaurant builder going at it for the first time, your objective might be to maximize your establishment’s available seating. You are required by law to keep to maximum occupancy. However, don’t just stuff seating anywhere you can while adhering to that number. Open space is something to be considered, as is minimizing any areas where table placement isn’t the best idea. Examples include directly adjacent to the restrooms or kitchen, and those situated in areas with poor ventilation. Instead, consider each table location carefully. Consider each individual’s experience by imagining yourself seated at each table, and in each seat. As you sit there, consider, is the ambiance, ventilation, and spacing worthy of a stellar review? By considering each seat that carefully, you are sure to avoid future problems that may cost you revenue and customer loyalty.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are you prepared to complete a restaurant tenant finish and need a little help? Do you require services for a complete restaurant construction build-out or renovation? If so, Hood Builder can help.

Here is your chance to bring your ideal vision of the perfect restaurant to life. There is a prime benefit to remodeling, as restaurants that continue to evolve are the ones that tend to remain relevant for years to come. You never want your eatery to look dated, so a remodel is an excellent idea.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before you start tearing down walls and opening buckets of paint, here are ten tips for unleashing your creativity while remodeling your restaurant with unique verve and style. </span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n<b></b>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h2 style=\"display: inline-block;\"><strong>Get Your Customers’ Input</strong></h2>\r\n<a href=\"/clients/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Restaurant owners</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tend to be more successful when they’re able to tap into the consciousness of their customers. What better way to get into the minds of those who keep you in business than to ask their opinion about your future restaurant remodel? </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Surveys and questionnaires on tabletops asking what they like about the restaurant, and what they don’t like, can give you countless ideas about how to change your restaurant layout. You can also ask for their creative input and reap untold benefits. You never know when some of your loyal patrons might offer insight into the perfect remodel to fit your vision and budget. </span></li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h2 style=\"display: inline-block;\"><b>Get Your Staff’s Input</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your staff members are the ones who see your restaurant every day they show up for work. Those servers and busboys, cooks, and managers might have a few ideas on how to change your seating, table positions, wall colors, and menu. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may even have a few interior decorating hopefuls working for your establishment, which can help you see your remodel concept from a fresh perspective. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One way that staff can help is to identify areas where your restaurant can become more efficient, thus shortening wait times and making your restaurant more enjoyable for all future customers and their families. </span></li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h2 style=\"display: inline-block;\"><b>Tour the Competition </b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many businesses engage in competitive analysis to find ways to become more customer-centric while increasing profits.

Identify areas where the restaurants get things right and where improvements should be made. Most of all, take lots of notes. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These tidbits of information can help you form the ideal remodel in your mind, making your job of planning and completing the </span><a href=\"/restaurant-design-tips-for-first-timers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">perfect restaurant makeover</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> much easier. </span></li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h2 style=\"display: inline-block;\"><b>For Bad Floors, Go Up a Level </b></h2>\r\n<span>Are your floors looking overly shabby? Do they need to be replaced? Switching out for your floor for a newer one is a major undertaking and can be expensive. </span><span>For about the same cost, and to add an interesting element to your restaurant remodel, a better idea is to include stairs and raise your floor up a level. Doing so makes customers feel as though they are stepping up to greatness while giving your restaurant a whole new look. You are encouraged to place recessed lighting on either side of the steps to give your new remodel concept extra appeal. </span></li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h2 style=\"display: inline-block;\"><b>Work with What You’ve Got</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remodeling your restaurant doesn’t automatically mean that you need to go out and get all new furnishings. Consider reworking your current inventory of chairs and tables to get more from your budget. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wooden tabletops can be sanded and finished, and chairs can be reupholstered. This can get rid of scratches and signs of age while giving your restaurant an interior design you can be proud of.</span></li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h2 style=\"display: inline-block;\"><b>The Exterior of Your Restaurant Matters</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s easy to get caught up on the interior design of your establishment, but don’t forget about your curb appeal. Customers considering eating at your restaurant will be more enamored with the location if you put effort into landscaping. You can also paint the outside, add awnings, or an outside patio area for those who wish to dine outdoors. </span><a href=\"/restaurant-construction-remodeling-in-denver/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interior and exterior restaurant design</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> doesn’t have to break the bank. Once again, look for ways to rework your current inventory of furnishings, paint, and other materials to give your eatery a sleek new appearance that customers are sure to love</span></li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h2 style=\"display: inline-block;\"><b><b>Punch Holes in Your Roo</b>f </b></h2>\r\n<span>Adding new lights is an excellent way to </span><a href=\"/faq/\"><span>remodel on a budget</span></a><span></span><span></span><span>. Well, there is no better light than natural sunlight. Punching holes in the roof and adding skylights is an excellent way to illuminate customer-facing areas for a rave-worthy dining experience. </span></li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h2 style=\"display: inline-block;\"><b>Rework Your Entrance </b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First impressions matter. Aside from your curb appeal, customers are going to judge your restaurant based on your front entrance. Therefore, consider redoing your front entrance, doors, front counter, and all. Add new lights and metal finishes, colored glass, and other effects to really wow your customers as they wait to be seated. </span></li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h2 style=\"display: inline-block;\"><b>Freshen Up Your Restrooms</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is nothing worse than eating at a nice restaurant only to find the restrooms disgusting. Look for ways you can add ease and elegance, not to mention cleanliness, to your restroom areas. This is also an opportunity to upgrade your restroom fixtures to save on water costs.</span></li>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h2 style=\"display: inline-block;\"><b>Ask a Restaurant Remodeler for Help</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.rewardsnetwork.com/blog/5-effective-restaurant-renovations-will-boost-business/\">Remodeling your restaurant</a> only remains exciting when you are able to fulfill your visions while keeping to your budget.

    "post_content": "<h2><b>What Do You Need to Consider When Buying an HVAC System?</b></h2>\r\n<a href=\"/services/hvac/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buying an HVAC system</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for your home or business can be confusing. There are so many components to deal with like the furnace, ductwork, heat pump, and air conditioning system that it is essential to hire a professional when buying and installing the ideal unit for your needs.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Until then, here are ten things to consider when buying the perfect HVAC system for your home or office.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><span><b>1- </b></span><strong>Calculating Your HVAC System Size </strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The size of your HVAC system will depend on how much space you need to heat or cool. Don’t think that you can just measure the square footage of your space and then buy the biggest sized heater or A/C unit you can afford. Rather, calculating the size of the unit that you need is a complex process that should only be completed by a skilled and experienced heating and air conditioning contractor.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The HVAC unit’s capacity must match the configuration of your home. A contractor will be able to determine your ductwork and heating and A/C requirements for every room in your home or office. Only by doing this due diligence can you be sure to get the best and most affordable system for the space allotted. </span>\r\n<h2><span><b>2- </b></span><strong>HVACs Can Have Affordable Prices  </strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a variety of HVAC system types, and costs may vary widely, depending on your specific needs. There are split heating and cooling systems, ductless A/C units, and packaged heating and air conditioning combinations or all-in-one units. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A central air conditioning system, for example, can cost as little as $3,500 and as much as $7,600 or more.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ductless HVAC systems are a little cheaper and range from $3K to $5K or more. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oil and gas furnaces can range from $4K to $5K while a geothermal heat pump can cost as much as $20K to $27K or more. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Talk to your HVAC contractor to determine the proper size and type of unit for the amount of space you are attempting to heat or cool.</span>\r\n<h2><span><b>3- </b></span><strong>Measuring HVAC Heating Capacity</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The capacity of a </span><a href=\"/services/hvac/heating/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">heating system</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is measured in BTU or British Thermal Units. 1 BTU is the amount of heat required to raise a pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. Be aware, however, that your HVAC system capacity may be showing either input or output. Input capacity represents the amount of gas burned (minus any losses due to combustion) while output capacity is how much heat is activated. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When assessing output capacity, you will notice that newer units have smaller input BTU ratings since they are far more efficient than older units. But, at the same time, more modern HVAC systems tend to have higher BTU output. Make sure you understand the capacity readout before buying.</span>\r\n<h2><span><b>4- </b></span><strong>Assessing A/C Capacity </strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the </span><a href=\"/services/hvac/air-conditioning/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">air conditioning system</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, you will want to look for the CFM or cubic feet per minute, which is how many cubic feet of usable air can pass through the system per minute. Also, air conditioning isn’t measured in single BTU like heating units. Instead, air conditioners use Ton. A single Ton is equal to 12,000 British Thermal Units per hour or BTUh.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When assessing the size of your HVAC unit, a skilled contractor will use a complicated measurement, usually ACCA’s Manual J requirements for proper sizing of an HVAC unit. Having the appropriate size is the best way to get efficient heating and air for plenty of savings. </span>\r\n<h2><span><b>5- </b></span><strong>System Efficiency Rating</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will also want to look at the efficiency rating system listed on each unit you consider.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are three types of ratings for HVAC systems. </span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<h3 style=\"display: inline-block;\"><strong>AFUE or Average Fuel Utilization Efficiency: </strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reserved for oil and gas furnaces, this rating indicates that the furnace converts a certain percentage of fuel to heat the space provided. A 98% AFUE rating, for example, means that the HVAC unit converts most of the oil and gas to heat your home or business. Look for furnaces with AFUE ratings of at least 78%.</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<h3 style=\"display: inline-block;\"><strong>HSPF or Heating Seasonal Performance Factor:</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This rating is for heat pumps. The higher the score, the less energy the system users. The most efficient HVAC pumps have ratings of 13 or higher. </span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<h3 style=\"display: inline-block;\"><strong>SEER or Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio:</strong></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> This rating measures the efficiency of the HVAC unit overall. A higher rating means the system uses less energy. Look for brands with ratings of at least 30 or higher. </span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><span><b>6- </b></span><strong>Noise Levels</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking at labels and calculating the size of your HVAC system are essential steps to take but be aware that some systems are noisier than others. It is difficult to assess how loud something might be just by viewing it on a website or seeing it on display in a store. That is why you might want to read online reviews to see if anyone complains that a particular model and size of the HVAC unit is extra loud. An overly loud unit may be able to cool your home or business effectively, but you will be mighty annoyed while the system is activated. When buying an HVAC unit, you want to feel comfortable with the level of heating, cooling, and noise. That is why you should make the level of sound a priority when selecting the perfect system for your needs. </span>\r\n<h2><span><b>7- HVAC System</b></span><strong> Maintenance &amp; Repair </strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When having a residential or </span><a href=\"/restaurant-kitchen-hvac-system/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">commercial HVAC unit installed</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, ask the contractor about a regular maintenance plan, such as once yearly. This will ensure that your machine and each component is looked after and updated if need be. You can also be sure that any malfunctions are corrected without harm to the rest of the unit, and so that your unit continues to run as efficiently as possible. Most installers of heating and cooling systems have yearly plans at affordable prices, such as the ones we offer at Hood Builder. </span>\r\n<h2><span><b>8- </b></span><strong>Consider Off-Season Shopping for Better Deals</strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here’s a pro-tip you might be able to take advantage of. When buying a heating unit, look for great deals in the summertime, when everyone is looking for air conditioners, and vice versa. When a system is in high demand, it is often charged at a higher price. Take advantage of off-season markdowns to save a little cash on your new heater or A/C system.</span>\r\n<h2><span><b>9- </b></span><strong>Get Reliable Installation Services </strong></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don’t trust your HVAC buying and installation to just anyone. Only a professional contractor who is experienced with your type of system should be trusted to install your recently purchased <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HVAC_control_system\">HVAC system</a>. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you are buying for a home or office, a skilled HVAC installer will ensure you buy the right size and capacity of the unit, and that you get one that is quiet as can be. You can get Energy Star efficient heaters and A/C systems that will keep your energy expenditures low while providing the warmth or cool air you need during the harsher summer and winter months.</span>\r\n\r\n<b>Call Now for a Free Quote &amp; Low HVAC Prices </b>\r\n<b></b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For installation of your HVAC system and to get the best and lowest cost system for your needs, we encourage you to call </span><a href=\"/about-us/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hood Builder</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, now serving clients in Denver, Colorado. </span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"/contact-us/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Call now</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for a free quote and let’s discuss the heating and air conditioning system you require for your home or office space.</span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\nSome Related Posts:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"/commercial-hvac-systems-introduction-comparison-various-heating-cooling-units/\"><span>Commercial HVAC Systems: An Introduction and Comparison of Various Heating &amp; Cooling Units</span></a></li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"/everything-you-wanted-know-about-hvac-systems/\"><span>Everything You Wanted to Know About HVAC Systems</span></a></li>\r\n \t<li><a href=\"/commercial-grease-trap-cleaning-services-importance/\"><span>Commercial Grease Trap Cleaning Services: Why You Should Be Putting Effort into Selecting the Best?</span></a></li>\r\n</ol>",

    "post_content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remodeling your restaurant requires you to find trained and experienced contractors to do all the heavy lifting. Even minor remodeling projects will require the expertise and input from tenured professionals. Want to add a new addition to your building or expand the dining room? A professional contractor will know how to complete those projects to your ultimate satisfaction while adhering to your timetable and budget. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are four things you should look for when hiring a restaurant remodeling professional by our restaurant remodeling experts in Denver, Colorado. </span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a class=\"js-scroll-trigger btn-default blue\" href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\">800-750-7055</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>1- A Solid Track Record Working with Similar Restaurants</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You would be best served finding a <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/remodeling/\">restaurant remodeling</a> contractor who has worked on restaurants with your volume and type of clientele. This type of contractor will know what budget you are working with and will be familiar with all building and safety codes. Ideally, you will also look for a contractor who is familiar with the type of remodeling you have in mind. Whether you are looking for a complete transformation or you merely wish to expand your dining and kitchen areas, there is a contractor out there who has expertise in the very remodeling project you envision. </span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>2- Has Relationships with the Best Remodeling Professionals in the Business</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your remodeling project will involve more than just the contractor you hire. You will need an architect to plan your remodel and to ensure the layout you have in mind is feasible. You may need an electrician if you want to upgrade your electrical system or lighting in any way. You could require an interior designer, a landscape artist, and a dozen others. Instead of hiring all of these professionals piece-meal, you can run a more efficient operation by gathering your team based on your contractor’s recommendations. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A restaurant remodeling contractor who has worked with businesses like yours likely has a black book filled with contacts who can bring your project to fruition. The contractor’s word of mouth can be considered gold because these individuals are likely skilled and able to make any project plan a reality. You could even say that finding the perfect remodeling contractor is akin to hiring an entire restaurant remodeling team in one individual, as long as the professional you choose has the contacts you need. </span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>3- Knows How to Stick to a Timetable and Budget</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A restaurant remodel is no small feat. Even minor reconfigurations can go hopelessly beyond your original schedule and budget. For that reason, you want to look for restaurant contractors who are known for delivering according to schedule while adhering to the required budget. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the professional to be worthy of your time, you will want to look for a restaurant remodeling contractor who is recommended because of his or her ability to deliver by the intended deadline. Many online platforms these days, like Angie’s List, allow customers to leave reviews for contractors all over the country. Read these reviews and pay attention to terms like “on schedule” and “by the deadline” or “right on time.” These are the contractors who will give you the speediness you want without cutting unnecessary corners.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For budgetary concerns, and just like you want a contractor who has a speed-dial list filled with other remodeling professionals, look for a contractor who has contacts with building material manufacturers and distributors. This type of restaurant contractor can save you loads in material and delivery costs. When you consider that your project will go according to plan and that you’ll save to boot, you can see how your choice of contractor can matter significantly.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finding both a contractor skilled at efficient design and one who can save you when remodeling your restaurant can save you money and headaches later on and is highly recommended for restaurant owners who want their projects going off without a hitch. </span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>4- Considers Your Ideas While Guiding the Ideal Restaurant Remodel</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even if you have no experience with remodeling a restaurant, you likely have a vision for how you want the project to go. You may have pictures in your mind of how the finished product should look, right down to the colors of the walls, lighting fixtures, and reconfigured bar, or whatever else you have in mind. Some of these ideas will be feasible, and some won’t; that’s just how it goes when you set out to plan a remodel with no actual concept of how the finished product is made.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A restaurant remodeling contractor has been there, done that. He or she knows how to plan the perfect layout for maximum seating and business. A professional worthy of your money know how to dress up your exterior and how to infuse stellar interior design so that customers become amazed and curious, forcing them to return again and again. This kind of foresight in design and restaurant reconstruction can only come from years of hands-on experience, and that is the type of professional you should be considering.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This level of the contractor will take your considerations and let you know if they will work or not. The professional you choose may even be able to take your ideas and make them better, amazing you with a finished product you never knew could be possible. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with experience, look for a restaurant contractor who has good ideas for your restaurant right off the bat. This person should have a portfolio of restaurants just like yours that was remodeled in a similar way, and that has a finished product that makes you excited to break new ground on your business.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of the above sounds ideal but hold the phone before you hire a contractor you suspect is the one you want. Here are a few points you will want to consider when selecting a professional for your <a href=\"https://www.rewardsnetwork.com/blog/5-effective-restaurant-renovations-will-boost-business/\">restaurant remodeling</a> needs. </span>\r\n<h3>Don’t Always Go with the Lowest Bid</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some contractors are going to drop their bids in an effort to get hired. Don’t fall for this trap without checking all of the professional’s other credentials, contacts, and experience. </span>\r\n<h3>Look at the Contractor’s Portfolio</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When considering a restaurant contractor, don’t just take the professional’s word for it that he or she has worked with other restaurants similar to yours. Ask for proof, as in pictures or videos of the finished products, so that you can be assured that your project will go over as planned.</span>\r\n<h3>Ask Plenty of Questions Before Hiring</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ask the contractor you are considering about their contact list and if they have access to a skilled architect, interior designer, and other remodeling professionals. Ask about how the contractor keeps to a schedule and adheres to budgetary concerns, and how many ideas the individual has for your specific business. </span>\r\n<h3>Request Client Referrals and Call Them</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once again, don’t just take the contractor’s word when he or she claims to have worked with other restaurant owners like you. Ask for those business owners’ contact information, but actually follow through. Too many people collect referrals from prospective contractors and then don’t call. The thinking is that the professional gave you the information; it must be legit. However, only by calling can you ask questions and get a better understanding of how the contractor works before going through the hiring process.  </span>\r\n<h3>Get Confirmation of Licensing and Insurance</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The contractor you hire should be licensed, bonded, and insured. Don’t just accept that the contractor has this information, but actually ask for proof. When checking licensing and insurance, make sure you check the dates so that you can confirm the documents are not expired or reaching expiration. </span>\r\n<h3>Ask About Zoning and Safety</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find out about the last time the contractor has had to deal with zoning issues and safety concerns. Have a few scenarios handy, such as if an expansion goes against zoning laws or if the professional is aware of fire safety laws and how they can affect a restaurant remodel. A contractor worthy of your money will be able to rattle off facts and satisfy your questions with knowledge of all federal and local laws that may apply.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere are  <a href=\"/restaurant-remodeling-tips/\">10 Creative Tips for Remodeling Your Restaurant</a>.\r\n<h2>Need the Services of a Restaurant Remodeling Contractor?

    "post_content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Renovation your restaurant can be an exciting venture. Takedown a few walls, add a room, and stock the interior with brand-new, all-stylish furnishings, and you have a recipe that can really wow your customers, causing them to visit and return often. A complete remodel done right can also get tongues wagging, making your eatery the talk of the town.</span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Read More About:</strong> <span> </span><a href=\"/restaurant-remodeling-contractor/\"><span><span class=\"post post-post current-item\">4 Things to Look for in a Restaurant Remodeling Contractor</span></span></a>\r\n<h2><b>Restaurant Renovation Tips for Breathing New Life into Your Business</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure you get the effect you are going for, we have compiled the top ten <a href=\"/restaurant-remodeling-tips/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">restaurant remodeling tips for restaurant owners</a> throughout Denver. Maybe your business has looked the same for ten, twenty, or more years. Perhaps you just want a chance to bring in more business. Not to worry; with a new environment and an influx of new customers, your restaurant is about to get a brand-new look and a healthy dose of business growth.</span>\r\n<h3><b></b> <b>Ask Your Customers for Their Input</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While remodeling your restaurant can deliver a steady stream of new customers, make sure you never forget about</span> your regulars. The ones who visit your restaurant repeatedly are really the ones stuffing your coffers. If you fail to meet the mark with your “new vision,” you risk alienating your base customer.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A better idea is to place suggestion cards way ahead of time before your remodel asking for the ideal layout, furnishings, wall colorings, and overall décor. You may find that your local area and loyal clientele have a different vision in mind entirely, forcing you to take on a remodel plan that doesn’t necessarily jive with the one you had in mind. The business owners who can follow their customers’ suggestions and specifications tend to be the ones who experience the most successful <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/remodeling/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">restaurant remodeling</a> projects. </span>\r\n<h3><b></b> <b>Dig Deep into Your Restaurant’s Vision</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go back to the day before you opened your establishment and think about the vision you had for the interior and exterior. Did you settle for some aspects of your restaurant that were already in existence in an effort to save money? For instance, did you keep the same furnishings and <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/design/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interior design</a> as the previous owners? If so, this is your chance to go back to the original plan, when you had a passion for a particular restaurant environment. With the right plan, that vision can come back to life. </span>\r\n<h3><b> Look for Ways to Streamline Operations</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remodeling a restaurant isn’t just about switching up the interior design. In some cases, your current layout may prove to be more trouble than it’s worth. For instance, is your current restaurant model lacking in adequate seating? A new remodel is an excellent opportunity to add more dining space and chairs for all the new customers you are sure to earn.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other considerations for remodeling your restaurant is getting rid of any seating that is located too near the restrooms and fitting your restaurant with mobility aids for customers who are disabled. Expanding your waiting area or your kitchen layout are two other ideas that are proving popular with restaurant owners intent on remodeling their businesses. More space equals more room for your customers and staff to move around, and more spots for <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/equipment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">kitchen equipment</a>, improving the efficiency of your business for more revenue all around.</span>\r\n<h3><b> Repurpose Original Furnishings &amp; Designs</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A restaurant remodel does not have to involve knocking down walls and transforming your business completely. Consider repainting the walls, re-staining, and painting furniture, or reupholstering furnishings for a budget-conscious remodel idea that can add a new look and feel for less. </span>\r\n<h3><b> Dress Up the Exterior </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take a look at the outside of your business from a customer’s perspective. Could your landscaping use a little sprucing up? Is there room for outdoor seating? If you already have a patio, is there a way to add more seats to please more customers? Other considerations include power washing your building, expanding your entrance, and adding color to the building to attract curious customers with improved curb appeal.</span>\r\n<h3><b> Reconstruct Your Bathrooms </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You could have the nicest restaurant for miles, but customers will be turned off quickly if your restrooms are ugly and dirty. Consider adding more space to your restrooms, changing your fixtures to more modern urinals and toilets, and switching out the sinks for something hands-free and space age. Your customers will be more likely to return if they are always impressed with your restroom options. </span>\r\n<h3><b> Focus on Where Your Revenue Comes From</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adding more seating will give you more customers to serve, but what about those significant drivers of your business, like alcohol? Have you thought about expanding your bar and making it more attractive? Restaurants see much higher margins from alcohol sales than from the meals they serve, so focus on where your money comes from and direct your restaurant renovation budget that way.</span>\r\n<h3><b> Plan to Go Over Budget </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter how strictly you plan for your restaurant renovation project, you will go over budget somehow, someway. It is almost inevitable. Therefore, it helps to overestimate your costs so that you are never surprised when it comes time to settle your accounts. </span>\r\n<h3><b> Have a Clear Plan Before You Begin</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like you are likely to go over budget, there is always some aspect of a <a href=\"https://www.rewardsnetwork.com/blog/5-effective-restaurant-renovations-will-boost-business/\">restaurant remodel</a> that doesn’t go exactly to plan. For instance, you may find that painting your restaurant takes longer than you first expected, or that one of your furniture deliveries is going to be delayed by a day or more. You can keep from tearing your hair out by creating a remodeling plan and adhering to it as closely as possible. While you’re at it, give your plan leeway and plan for any hiccups that can grind things to a halt if they’re not anticipated beforehand. Creating a plan and contingencies will save you loads of money and headaches while keeping the renovation of your restaurant on schedule, no matter what. </span>\r\n\r\n<strong>Read More About:</strong>  <a href=\"/restaurant-remodeling-tips/\"><span>Restaurant Remodel Tips: 10 Creative Tips you should know</span></a>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/restaurant-designjpg-1.jpg\" alt=\"Restaurant Build Up | Restaurant Design Placentia | Hood Builder | Denver Colorado\" width=\"800\" height=\"532\" class=\"wp-image-2039 size-full aligncenter\" />\r\n<h2><b> Select the Right Restaurant Renovation Team</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to finding an architect, designer, and one or more <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/construction/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">contractors</a>, you should never scrimp in an effort to save on costs.

    "post_content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a business owner, you may not be familiar with the latest brands and models of the commercial HVAC system. When people talk of HVAC, air conditioning, heating, makeup air, and ventilation, there is so much to choose from that the topic can quickly get confusing.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To help alleviate some of the confusion surrounding commercial <a href=\"/services/hvac/\">HVAC system</a>, here is a handy guide comprised of all the types of systems available. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you have a small, medium, or a large business, knowing this information will help you find the ideal HVAC setup.</span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Air Conditioning Systems</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Air conditioning systems used in commercial establishments need to have a variety of heating and cooling capabilities and come with several different setups and layouts.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The main types of commercial air conditioning units consist of Single Split Systems, Multi-Split Systems, and VRF or VRV Systems.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While all of these systems use the same basic technology and nearly identical wall or ceiling mounted units, they have different applications. </span>\r\n<h3>Split System Air Conditioning</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Single split systems used in commercial buildings are the most affordable and suited for small to medium-sized environments. The units offer both heating and cooling to individual rooms, which makes them ideal for coffee shops, offices, and cafes. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Multiple single split systems can be used together to serve larger spaces or even multiple rooms. The only downside is that you need an outdoor unit for every indoor unit, which means you’ll need the required space if you hope to go with several single split A/C systems.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, having a few single splits is cheaper than buying a central system, and you can easily replace a single system as opposed to having to diagnose a complicated problem with a central A/C configuration. </span>\r\n<h3>Multi-Split A/C Systems</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These air conditioning setups work nearly the same as single split units, but you can connect up to nine indoor units to a single outdoor unit. As you can see, there aren’t as many space requirements, making this A/C configuration ideal if you can afford the cost. You can also successfully preserve the aesthetic of your outdoor environment, as opposed to having to house a variety of single splits in your patio area. </span>\r\n<h3>VRF or VRV Air Condition Systems</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VRF or Variable Refrigerant Flow or VRV or Variable Refrigerant Volume essentially mean the same thing. Daikin is the brand that originally developed the technology and called it VRV. The company then protected the term to prevent other manufacturers from using it, which is why everyone else calls it VRF.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">VRF/VRV A/C is the best solution for hotels, retail spaces, larger offices, and another medium to large applications. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two types of VRF/VRV air conditioning systems.</span>\r\n<h3>Heat Pump</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heat pump VRF/VRV systems provide heating and cooling to a building, making them ideal for open plan areas. </span>\r\n<h3>Heat Recovery</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heat recovery VRF/VRV systems are able to provide simultaneous heating and cooling to different areas at the same time. This makes the A/C system perfect for buildings with many individual rooms, as they recover waste heat from around the building and use it to heat other rooms and hot water. Heat recovery systems are more flexible as you can heat one room and cool another. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the commercial air conditioning service you work with, you may hear A/C systems referred to in other ways.</span>\r\n<h3>Duct-Free Split Systems</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These air conditioning systems use the same basic technology as the split systems with a major difference. While other split systems use ducts to move the treated air into rooms throughout the building, duct-free systems must be placed directly into the rooms they are intended to cool. These rooms will also need to have an outward-facing wall. The blower in a duct-free A/C system is contained in the indoor unit, which allows it to blow treated and much cooler air into the room. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, the size and sheer visual presence of the ductless split systems can make them impractical for customer-facing businesses. That is because many see them as noisy and obtrusive. They are a better fit for workshops and other open areas where most of the work is completed in a single room, and where an upscale atmosphere isn’t needed for visiting customers. </span>\r\n<h3>Packaged System Air Conditioners</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Packaged A/Cs contains all the components of an air conditioner in the same area. Split systems have the compressor and condenser coils inside the outdoor unit, whereas the evaporator is contained inside to absorb heat from the interior air. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With a packaged air conditioning system, the components are all kept inside a box that sits against the wall on the outside of the building. This makes the units much less visually obtrusive to people on the inside of your building. Though, the units can be an eyesore to passersby.</span>\r\n<h3>Ductless Mini Split System A/C</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These air conditioners are similar to the duct-free split system air conditioners mentioned earlier. The major difference is that they are smaller and make much less noise. This helps business owners enjoy the convenience of having a ductless <a href=\"/services/hvac/air-conditioning/\">air conditioning</a> system without compromising the appearance of their interior space. It should be noted that large rooms or buildings can require that you install multiple ductless mini-split system A/C units before they can begin to cool your space effectively. This might reduce the cost-effectiveness of these models, so choose wisely based on the space you have to work with.</span>\r\n<h3>Standard Ducted Split System Air Conditioners</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Standard split systems have an indoor unit, an outdoor unit, and ducts that move the treated air to the necessary rooms. Ducted split system air conditioners can be a good solution for restaurants and businesses with multiple areas to heat and cool, but beware. They have difficulty to diagnose when something goes wrong, so it pays to have professionals on hand who can inspect and maintain your ducted system over time. This will keep the system working as it should while keeping your energy bills to an absolute minimum. </span>\r\n<h3>Makeup Air Systems</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Makeup air systems replace the air that is removed by the <a href=\"/services/hoods/fans/\">exhaust fans</a>. The system pulls in fresh air from outside of your building and filters it inside to replace existing air that cannot be recirculated. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Makeup air systems are recommended for buildings where environmental concerns warrant a greater need for ventilation to improve the quality of air, and to protect the health of those located inside.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a wide variety of <a href=\"/services/hoods/make-up-air/\">commercial makeup air systems</a> available. The type you choose will depend on your requirements, where you want the makeup air system to be located and your budget. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the most common types of <a href=\"/services/hvac/make-up-air/\">makeup air systems</a> available. </span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Heated Makeup Air Systems</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These systems heat the air before it is filtered into the building. The system is mounted to the room and blows air downward. Or, there is also a side discharge unit, which can be mounted outside at ground level so the air can be blown in through the wall.</span>\r\n<h3>Cooled Makeup Air Systems</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These systems cool the air before it is filtered inside and have both downward discharge and side discharge units available. </span>\r\n<h3>Simple Fan Unit</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These makeup air configurations blow air directly into the interior of your building. There are both downward discharge units and side discharge units available, depending on if you want the fan mounted on the roof or at ground level.  </span>\r\n<h2>Heating Systems</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Heating systems designed for commercial use can be complex. This is because they are required to heat areas with higher square footage when compared with residential heating units. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the most common heating systems available for commercial establishments.</span>\r\n<h3>Natural Energy</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These systems use sustainable resources like solar or geothermal power. These heaters represent fairly new technology in the United States, but they are very kind to the environment and can save you loads in energy bills in the future. The cost of the units themselves and the installation costs can be prohibitive, but the systems tend to be more cost-effective over time when compared to systems that use fossil fuels.</span>\r\n<h3>Oil and Gas Steam Heating</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The oil and gas steam configuration are one of the oldest forms of commercial heating systems. The units use fossil fuels to boil, condense, and then pass the steam through pipes in order to heat a building. Not only is this technology behind the times, but it’s also the least cost-efficient out of all the commercial system types available. The systems are also slow to heat a room, making them less than ideal for most applications. </span>\r\n<h2>Gas or Oil Water Systems</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Water-based <a href=\"/restaurant-kitchen-hvac-system/\">HVAC</a> configurations that are powered by gas or oil are another option you can consider. The units are smaller than those used in producing heat. The water is passed through radiators throughout the building. These systems are also less efficient than other methods, as the air must be cleared before the heat is engaged. </span>\r\n<h3>Heat Pumps</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commercial heat pumps are very cost-efficient. The processes are similar to the technology used in refrigeration as the systems extract heat from cold air, then use a refrigerant to pump generated heat throughout the property. Heat pumps don’t need fossil fuels to function, so heat pump systems are considered an option that is kinder to the environment. </span>\r\n<h2>Ventilation Systems</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Commercial ventilation systems are comprised of ductwork that is typically run through the ceiling and into each room. Each room contains a rectangular opening that allows for efficient airflow.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a variety of common parts found in commercial heating and cooling ventilation systems. </span>\r\n<h3>Air Handler</h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This unit is also sometimes referred to as an air handler unit or AHU. The air handler attaches directly to the duct system and is made of a large metal box that contains a blower, cooling and heating elements, filter racks, sound attenuators, and dampers. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The metal box is manufactured from galvanized sheet metal and is designed to regulate and circulate the air as part of the ventilation system. An AHU can be designed for both indoor and outdoor use. The latter is known as a package unit (PU) or rooftop unit (RTU).</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dampers regulate the airflow inside your establishment. There are two types of dampers available. Volume Control Dampers let the volume of airflow be adjusted, while Combination Smoke and Fire Dampers are designed to seal off the ductwork entirely when smoke and fire are detected. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then there are air measuring dampers, low leakage, thermal, <a href=\"/services/air-balancing/\">balancing</a>, marine, tunnel transit, and many more. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duct fittings and configurations can include tees, ells, and reducers. These components are responsible for equalizing the duct pressure while balancing the airflow. For instance, a reducer is used when switching from one sized duct to another.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is also a vent cap that provides protection for the open end of the ductwork stack. Each fitting and configuration help the ductwork perform its duties efficiently, which is to allow the free flow of clean and conditioned air. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duct outlets can include registers, grilles, and diffusers. These parts divide the airflow between a trunk and branch design. For instance, diffusers allow the conditioned air to be distributed evenly with minimal noise. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, no commercial ventilation system would be complete without vents. These are placed in the ceiling with their edges corresponding to the opening of the duct system. Warm or cool air will pour through the commercial ductwork, allowing it to disperse to the rooms below. </span>\r\n<h2>How Do These Systems Compare?</h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By now you have lots of questions – do you need a commercial <a href=\"/services/hvac/heating/\">HVAC system</a>, air conditioner, heater, <a href=\"/services/hvac/ventilation/\">ventilation system</a>, or all of the above? And with all the brands and models to choose from, how do you know which components will give you the cleanest air, most energy savings, and greatest value for your budget? </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The fact is, all of these systems differ depending on the size and type of your business, your budget, aesthetic needs, and a host of other factors. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The best solution is to work with a commercial HVAC service company that can not only answer all your questions but can also point you in the direction of the perfect commercial <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HVAC_control_system\">HVAC system</a> for your needs and budget. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"/\"> Hoodbuilder</a> can help you find the perfect HVAC, heating and cooling, and ventilation components to suit your needs, and we can provide full maintenance and service of those units over the course of their lifetime.

Or, you may need other types of equipment more specific to your establishments, such as a tortilla maker or bread maker. Make sure you are considering every aspect of your kitchen layout and menu plan when developing your restaurant <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/equipment/\">equipment list</a>. </span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>The Most Popular Commercial Kitchen Equipment </b></h2>\r\n<h3><b>Range</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A kitchen range is a must for all commercial kitchens. The range is the centerpiece of the kitchen layout. Therefore, make sure you find one that meets your specific cooking needs. Commercial ranges come in gas and electric varieties. If you want a more visual cooking experience, gas is the way to go.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A gas range is easier to judge the heat levels. You can change from high to low much easier than you can with an electric range. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although, electric ranges are easier to clean and tend to have smoother and more elegant designs.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Ventilation Hoods</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter what type of range you opt for, make sure you have the proper <a href=\"/services/hvac/ventilation/\">ventilation system</a> to support it. <a href=\"/services/hvac/\">Range hoods</a>, which sit directly on top of stoves and broilers, use <a href=\"/services/hvac/air-conditioning/\">powerful fans</a> to suction grease, heat, and moisture through filters and out of the kitchen. These hoods can be custom-built for any appliance and location. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Oven</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most ranges sold for restaurant use will also come fitted with an oven. If your operation sells primarily baked goods, you might want to invest in a range with a convection oven attached. Unlike standard ovens, convection ovens have an exhaust system that blows heated air over the food. These ovens are ideal for roasting foods, dehydrating, and making pies.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For foods that are made from batter, a regular oven should do the trick. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Deep Fryer</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A deep fryer can be used to heat fats and oils and are ideal for making French fries and other fried foods. The cooking appliances come in a range of sizes and with optional features like timing mechanisms and oil draining capabilities for easier cleaning.  </span>\r\n<h3><b>Commercial Mixer </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your establishment bakes bread or desserts, a commercial mixer is a critical purchase. Think about the volume of baked items you produce each day to help you determine the size of the mixer you need. Spiral mixers are ideal for restaurants that mix dense doughs like pizzas and bagels. These high-speed mixing devices can handle fifty to six hundred pounds of dough at a time. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For other types of mixing, a planetary mixer might do the trick. This mixer gets its name by the way the mixing bowl rotates around the agitator. They usually have lower mixing speeds than the spiral mixers, but you can make a lot of different foods with them, such as whipped cream and mashed potatoes. You can find mixers of all sizes, from ones that fit on the countertop to mega-mixers that stand upright.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Food Processor</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are four different types of food processors that you can choose from. A batch bowl processor collects food as it’s being processed. The devices hold between one and six quarts of chopped food, but they can also come in larger sizes. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Continuous feed food processors let you add food while it’s running. The food is then dispensed into a separate container, which means you don’t have to <a href=\"/services/hoods/cleaning/\">continually clean</a> the container while it’s running. These processors can minimize food preparation times when processing large quantities of food, making them a terrific option for commercial kitchens of all types.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then there are buffalo choppers, which are heavy-duty, all-metal food processors that are capable of chopping veggies, meats, and a variety of other foods.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, you have your combination processors, which mix together properties of batch bowl and continuous feed food processing units. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Reach-In and/or Walk-In Cooler</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Without a refrigerator, your restaurant won’t be able to keep foods fresh and safe for human consumption. Look for industrial-grade refrigeration units that are designed for your specific type of restaurant and that meet the unique needs of the food industry. For instance, some fridges have space and the ability to cool large amounts of sauce quickly. Taking the time to find the right reach-in or walk-in coolers can do wonders for efficiency and food quality.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Walk-In Freezer</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A walk-in freezer is critical for inventory management. Beef, chicken, even swordfish will need to be frozen when not in immediate use. It is much more cost-effective to buy food in bulk, then freeze it, as opposed to buying small amounts each day. Just like walk-in coolers, spend time looking for the most energy-efficient walk-in freezer that is spacious enough to accommodate your needs. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Ice Machine </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No restaurant is quite complete without an ice machine. How else are you going to keep your drinks cold on a significant scale? Your ice machine is responsible for making ice on a constant basis. That means that it must be ready to use and serve at all times. The ice can be dispensed into an ice bin or directly into your soda fountains, depending on the brands you buy.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ice machines can also be used to make blended drinks like margaritas, slushies, and smoothies.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Slicers</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Slicers are used to cut meats and cheeses with precision. If you prepare a lot of sandwiches and other items that need to be sliced, consider investing in an electric slicer, which will make the job much easier. A manual slicer can work for low-volume slicing, however. Of course, many electric slicers give you the option of turning the automation off, letting you use it as a manual slicer. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Cutting Boards</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cutting boards are essential for restaurants of all types and come in a variety of sizes. Some are made of plastic and others are made of wood. Plastic boards are easier to clean, but they can become scarred by deep grooves that can become breeding grounds for bacteria.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wooden cutting boards are tougher to clean than plastic but stand up to sharp objects better without all the bacteria-rich grooves.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure you color-code your cutting boards or develop some kind of system so that you don’t cross-contaminate. Many kitchens use a system where red stands for meat, yellow for chicken, blue for fish, and green for veggies. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Food Preparation Counters</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to cutting boards, we recommend stainless steel food preparation surfaces. Stainless steel guards against corrosion and prevents the absorption of bacteria from meat juices and other foods. Stainless steel cutting boards can also withstand many heavy-duty cleaning products. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some stainless-steel counters come with small refrigerators underneath, giving you easy access to the food you need to prepare at each station. Some also have refrigeration units on the counter itself. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Plastic Inserts for Coolers</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here we are talking about good sealable storage containers. Make sure you get the sizes you need and that you have plenty of tape and Sharpies available for labeling food items that will eventually expire. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you’re at it, you will want to make sure you have adequate storage racks and shelving in your walk-ins to accommodate your storage containers. The idea is to keep your operations efficient so that food items can be found at a moment’s notice, no matter how busy your kitchen gets.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Steam Table</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A steam table will keep sauces and prepared food items warm throughout the day. They use heated water to keep food at the proper temperatures. The foods themselves are kept in metal containers and can remain at safe edible levels for several hours at a time. </span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Restaurant-Equipment-Checklist-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1707\" height=\"2560\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2088 size-full\" />\r\n<h3><b>Sinks</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sinks are vital to a commercial kitchen because they provide spaces for cleaning dishes, handwashing, and defrosting meat, and other uses. Local health and safety regulations recommend that you have a triple-sink wash station and dishwashing machine, as well as a dedicated sink for handwashing. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Dishwasher </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A three-stage commercial dishwasher can effectively clean your tools and dishes in minutes. These heavy-duty machines reduce the labor time it would take to wash each dish and utensil by hand. You can find a variety of makes and models of dishwashers on the market and each comes with its own levels of size and affordability. Make sure you buy a dishwashing unit that is large enough to handle the volume of dishes you will need during your busiest shifts.</span>\r\n<h3><b>POS System</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A point of sale system helps you track all of the orders and transactions that take place day-to-day in your restaurant. Your wait staff can input customer orders into the POS terminals where they will be received by the kitchen staff for fast and efficient service. Since all meals are accounted for, there is less waste, and mistakes are kept to a minimum. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will also need a POS printer, which prints off tickets for kitchen staff to use for each meal order. The printer also works for creating bills and receipts for customers. Ideally, you will have several terminals and printers located at strategic areas throughout your restaurant. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Safety Equipment </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Health and safety regulations exist to protect employees and customers from hazardous conditions. As a restaurant owner or manager, you have a responsibility to provide a safe and comfortable atmosphere that is perfect for enjoying a meal or drink. You can do this by stocking up on items that keep your staff and premises safe, like security cameras, wet floor signs, <a href=\"/services/fire-suppression-systems/\">fire extinguishers</a>, oven mitts, aprons, and goggles.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Smallware and Linens </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may be focused on all the large items you are forced to buy when stocking a restaurant, but don’t forget about the malware. These little items can quickly add to your expense. By being aware of all the items you need, you can budget accordingly. Smallware means getting stock and saucepans, sauté and frying pans, sheet, and roasting pans, chefs’ knives, hand tools like spatulas and spoons, as well as cake or pie tins.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to malware, you should also stock up on linens. Your kitchen staff will need towels and rags to clean with and prevent injuries from handling hot equipment. A separate set of linens should be used by the back of the house to clean spills and prevent slips and falls.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Janitorial Equipment </b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A clean restaurant is a popular restaurant. You can ensure every area of your restaurant is customer-ready by ensuring you stock up on all necessary janitorial equipment. Cleaning supplies to invest in include foodservice chemicals and sanitizers, trash cans and recycling bins, mops and mop buckets, and wet floor signs. You might also want to stock up on scrubbers, sponges, restroom supplies, brooms, and dustpans, as well as cleaning chemical buckets. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Rubber Floor Mats</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rubber mats are required for any commercial kitchen to prevent dangerous slips and falls. Not only do rubber mats make your restaurant safer, but they are more comfortable to stand on during busy shifts than standard tile flooring.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Grease Trap</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every restaurant produces grease, there are no two ways around it. You need a way to capture all that grease before it backs into the sewer or creates a deadly fire hazard. A <a href=\"/services/general-contracting/grease-trap/\">grease trap</a> stores leftover grease and prevents it from clogging your drains or backing up into the local sewer system. Choose a grease trap that fits with the volume you plan to produce and make sure you schedule regular cleaning to keep the trap clean.</span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Restaurant-Equipment-Checklist-Restaurant-Equipment-cleaning--scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1702\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2090 size-full\" />\r\n<h2><b>The Importance of Having the Right Kitchen Equipment </b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It doesn’t matter what type of restaurant you own or operate; you need the right <a href=\"https://www.lightspeedhq.com/blog/restaurant-equipment-list/\">equipment</a> to prepare your delicious offerings.

    "post_content": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic has been unprecedented and countries are still struggling to get back to their old normal. People have stayed indoors for months in a row. Even developed nations are reeling under the pressure of a weak economy. It is tough to say how long the coronavirus will continue to play havoc. Now, many nations have started to relax the stay-at-home restrictions and allowed some selective categories of businesses to open in a phased manner. As people, food premises, and workplaces are trying to resume their businesses, it is crucial to follow the precautionary measures for protection against Covid-19.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you run a <a href=\"/services/hoods/installation/\">commercial kitchen</a> or have a workplace, you should keep all the cleaning of Your Workplaces and surfaces clean. There are disinfectants and sanitizers that you can use to enhance protection against Covid-19.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Cleaning Food Premises</h2>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Covid-19 has created a risky situation for every restaurant, food premise or food store. As food establishments start to reopen, owners should pay serious attention to the cleanliness and hygiene for the safety of the staff and guests. If guests and workers don’t feel safe under the current pandemic, they won’t come and your restaurant business will suffer as a result. Local authorities too will require you to follow some safety guidelines as long as Covid-19 risk looms.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United States Food &amp; Drug Administration has shared guidelines in this regard for food stores and food establishments to follow. From the <a href=\"/services/hoods/cleaning/\">kitchen hood system</a>, cooking utensils, food prep surfaces and ovens to refrigerators and the walls and floors, the food establishment owners are responsible for managing the cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting of the entire restaurant to ensure better safety and health of the employees and the guests. Each area of a commercial kitchen requires a different approach for cleaning and sanitization. If you lack expert knowledge about <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/cleaning/\">kitchen cleaning</a>, you should hire a professional company.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s not that cleaning and disinfecting are new practices. Food premises and commercial kitchens have long been abiding by the cleanliness and good hygiene for the health and safety of workers and customers. But the current pandemic has put cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting under great focus. All restaurants, that are now reopening, are required to strictly take cleanliness measures.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Restaurants and food premises need to focus on the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Practice Hand Hygiene:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you run a food store, hand hygiene is the first important thing to follow. Whether it is your employees or the customers that visit your establishment, you should make sure they wash their hands frequently to reduce the risk of coronavirus infection. If soap and water are not available, provide them with alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Kitchen workers, who have greasy or dirty hands, should first remember to clean their hands and then use hand sanitizers. Otherwise, using hand sanitizers will not be useful.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Clean Surfaces and Equipment:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keep a close watch on the surfaces and don’t let dust gather anywhere. Dirty surfaces make it easy for harmful bacteria and germs to grow. By cleaning the surfaces on a regular basis, you can immediately reduce the chances of breeding of pathogens. Whether it’s cooking surfaces, cooking utensils, commercial kitchen walls, grills, <a href=\"/services/hoods/fans/\">kitchen hoods</a>, sinks or the oven, you should make sure that all the surfaces and equipment are cleaned frequently. In any case, don’t forget to clean the glasswasher and the dishwasher.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Sanitize Surfaces:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanitization is a process through which you can eradicate the pathogens or bring the number of harmful germs down to a level that is considered to be safe. There is a large variety of chemicals and products that you can use to sanitize the food contact surfaces. It is important to use sanitizers on all <a href=\"/services/hoods/installation/\">kitchen hoods</a>, sinks, faucets, coffee machines etc. The cooking utensils and kitchen walls, as well as kitchen floors, should be sanitized as well. Always remember to use a strong sanitizer and leave it for enough time for proper sanitization.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Disinfect High Touch Surfaces:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disinfectants are used to kill pathogens. You should apply disinfectant to frequently touched surfaces in your food premise. This should be done in addition to cleaning of surfaces. In this way, you can bring down the risk of spreading the infection to a great extent.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cleaning and sanitizing have been in practice by foodservice operations. Covid-19 has taken this one step ahead to disinfecting. Now, all food stores and food premises need to pay more attention to disinfecting, which means killing harmful germs, bacteria, and pathogens on surfaces. So, while you should regularly clean the food contact surfaces and sanitize surfaces, you should never forget to use disinfectants to further enhance the safety of your kitchen staff and guests.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is plenty to sanitize and disinfect inside a commercial restaurant. Whether it is the restaurant tables, food preparation surfaces or the <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/equipment/\">kitchen equipment</a>, you’ll need to keep all these free from pathogens. There are special sanitizers for each of these items and surfaces. For example, sanitizing rinses are available for dishes and cooking utensils in a kitchen. Likewise, there are sanitizers for the sanitization of cooking surfaces inside a commercial kitchen.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A commercial kitchen is a pretty big place with lots of areas, surfaces and items that need cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting. It is a good idea to create a checklist of all the items and decide a specific frequency for cleaning them. For example, items such as the grill, range, griddle, flattops, coffee makers, prep area surfaces, beverage dispenser heads need more frequent cleaning and disinfecting. Waste disposal areas and trash cans also need disinfecting on a daily basis. There are other items or areas that can be cleaned and disinfected on a weekly or monthly basis. These include deep fryers, walk-in refrigerator, ice machine, vent hoods, etc.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cleaning and disinfecting the kitchen floor is an important task. Though it sounds like a simple task, it is actually a complex one. The floor gathers plenty of grease over time, which is a safety hazard. A traditional bucket and mop will not remove this grease buildup from the floor.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cleaning a greasy floor requires the use of the right type of chemicals and the right approach and technique. Give HoodBuilder a quick call to schedule a consultation for proper cleaning of your kitchen floor.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Sanitize-covide-19-scaled-e1609253047860.jpg\" alt=\"Sanitize-covide-19\" width=\"1708\" height=\"1292\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2093 size-full\" />\r\n<h2>Cleaning Your Workplace</h2>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Offices, government buildings, and reception areas need proper and thorough cleaning on a regular basis to reduce the spread of Covid-19. Even if you have an office or workplace in an area where there is no community spread of Covid-19, you should take all the precautionary measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>General Cleaning:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just because you have sanitizers and disinfectants, it doesn’t mean cleaning is not important. In fact, cleaning is essential as it eliminates dust and dirt from surfaces. If dirt and organic matter stay on surfaces, they can make it easy for harmful bacteria and germs to breed. Even when you want to disinfect a surface, you should first clean that surface.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Disinfection:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a surface has been cleaned, it may still have pathogens. Cleaning only reduces pathogens, it doesn’t kill them. On the other hand, disinfectants kill germs and pathogens that remain after cleaning. Therefore, using disinfectant is a surefire way of reducing the risks of infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Routine Cleaning:</h3>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A workplace can be big or small. It can be used by a number of people or a few people. Depending on the amount of traffic in the workplace, you should decide the frequency of cleaning. Those areas that are frequently accessed by the public should be cleaned more frequently. You should keep an eye out for dust or dirt anywhere in the workplace and make sure that you get it cleaned as soon as you spot it. During the Covid-19 pandemic, it is crucial to be extremely careful in regard to the cleaning of all areas in the workplace.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Workplaces tend to get cluttered very often. To keep the entire workplace in good order and create a healthy environment, you should declutter in an effective manner. This is also important because a decluttered workplace is easier to clean. Whether it is the desks, keyboards or telephones, each essential item in the workplace needs cleaning on a regular basis. In a workplace, all the frequently touched areas need cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting on a regular basis.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the workplace, you need to create awareness around Covid-19 and how everyone can help prevent the spread of coronavirus. You should place sanitizing hand rub dispensers throughout the workplace so that employees and visitors can easily access them to sanitize their hands. Hand washing should be promoted through banners and posters. At the same time, make hand washing easy for employees and visitors. Using soap and water is best for washing hands. Washing hands frequently prevents the spread of the Covid-19 infection.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How to Clean and Disinfect</h2>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Covid-19 related cleaning and disinfecting, there are some guidelines that should be followed. Cleaners should wear gloves before getting started with the process. There are reusable gloves that can be used for this purpose. After the task is complete, the gloves can be removed, cleaned, and dried.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The process begins with cleaning. Use a detergent solution to properly clean all the areas and surfaces in the food premise, kitchen, or workplace. After the surfaces have been cleaned, it is time for the application of disinfectants. Use a paper towel or a disposable cloth to apply the chemical to surfaces. Always ensure you use high-quality products and follow the manufacturer’s guidelines. Pay attention to the ‘contact time’ when you apply disinfectant to a surface. You need to leave the chemical on the surface for some time so as to kill the viruses.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Safety is important even when cleaning the different areas of a <a href=\"https://robinpowered.com/blog/tips-office-safety\">workplace</a> or a food establishment. While cleaning is going on, the cleaning people should avoid touching their eyes, nose and mouth. For greater protection, surgical masks can also be used. The cleaning staff should also sanitize their hands before wearing and after removing hand gloves.</p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HB-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Sanitize-covide-19| Restaurant Remodeling | Hood Builder | Denver Colorado\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1702\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2094 size-full\" /></h2>\r\n<h2>Choosing the Disinfectant Solution</h2>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it is a commercial kitchen or an office, cleaners should always use high-quality disinfectant solutions. There are different types of disinfectants including chlorine dioxide, sodium hypochlorite, hydrogen peroxide, quaternary ammonia, Audobon disinfectant etc. Chlorine-based disinfectants or those with 70% alcohol have anti-viral properties. So, it is important to find out whether the disinfectant solution you are using is formulated for anti-viral activity.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using household bleach is another option. This disinfectant solution is available in a variety of strengths. You can read the details about the solution to the product label. Quaternary ammonium compounds are also a good alternative for a disinfectant solution. In fact, these chemicals are known to combine two properties into one - detergent and disinfection property.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Disinfectant solutions contain harmful chemicals.

    "post_content": "<a href=\"https://www.pinterest.se/\">Image Source</a>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Food trucks have come a long way from the early days of mobile dining. Today, people derive as much joy eating from a food truck as dining at a brick and mortar restaurant. From sandwiches and hamburgers to cupcakes and hybrid taco-waffles, food trucks offer a wide range of delectable menu items.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But when exactly did mobile dining begin? Who invented the idea of selling food from a food truck? Let us dig into the past.</span>\n<h2><b>Chuck Wagon - The Original Food Truck</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chuckwagons are a direct ancestor of the modern-day food truck. Long back in 1866, there lived a rancher in Texas, named Charles Goodnight. The idea of the chuck wagon struck Goodnight’s mind when he felt the need to feed cattlemen going on long cattle drives. So, he got a surplus US Army wagon and turned it into what we now call a food truck. Goodnight attached a chuck box to the back of the wagon to make it easy to cook and prepare food, hence the name.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Goodnight modified the chuck wagon and designed multiple portions in it to cook food, store supplies, keep a water barrel etc.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Initially, the use of chuck wagons was limited to the cattle industry. Over time, the idea of mobile dining picked up steam and the role of chuck wagons expanded to serve the eating needs of other industries and classes. Common food items sold through chuck wagons included salted meat, beans, coffee, biscuits etc. Goodnight’s portable kitchen went on to make a lasting impact.</span>\n<h2><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/w400-1-300x216.jpg\" alt=\"Modern Food Trucks\" width=\"300\" height=\"216\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-2167 aligncenter\"></h2>\n<h2><b>Pushcarts - Another Predecessor of the Food Truck</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yet another ancestor of the modern-day food truck is pushcarts. In fact, the history of pushcarts is older than that of chuck wagons. When Dutch immigrants arrived in New York city, they looked for ways to make some money. They started the use of food carts to sell food. New York city and Chicago were places where these push carts were more common to see.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 1691, laws were also formulated to control the selling of food by these mobile food vendors. Pushcarts mainly served the eating needs of the urban working class, specially those who were looking for inexpensive meals.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The early pushcarts did not cook or prepare food on-site. They only sold food items that were ready to eat.</span>\n\n<b>Modern Food Trucks</b>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chuck wagons have almost disappeared from the mobile food vending scene today. They are no longer used to cook food. However, you’ll definitely see different variations of the pushcart in many US cities.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Refrigerated ice cream trucks, which came up in the 1950s, became another inspiration for food vendors. The number of food trucks increased across the cities of the United States. Construction workers formed a strong customer base for mobile food vendors around the 1960s.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, the moment we hear the word ‘food truck’, delicacies such as fish tacos, pork sandwiches and home-cooked Mediterranean food start to make our mouths water. The shape and design of food trucks have undergone a revolution. They have now become so ubiquitous and serve food items to all classes including working professionals as well as the younger generation. Food trucks don’t just offer variety in terms of food items, but they also cater to every budget. Modern-day food trucks are not like the ‘roach coaches’ of the early years. They follow the highest standards of cleanliness to ensure the health and safety of all customers.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"/services/food-trucks-design-fire-suppression-installation-services/\">Food trucks</a> continue to get better. Many of them have also adopted new technologies to simplify business management. Customers can now pay and avail themselves of loyalty programs via street food apps.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\n&nbsp;",

    "post_content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A commercial kitchen is a hub of a range of cooking activities. If you run a restaurant kitchen, you will have to deal with plenty of heat, smoke, and odor on a regular basis. Plus, the grease buildup inside the ductwork and the exhaust fans will prevent proper ventilation, unless cleaned on a regular basis. Too much grease and grime are potential fire hazards, which must be eliminated. If you fail to properly maintain the exhaust hood and the ventilation system, you will find it hard to run the restaurant smoothly and cause great discomfort to staff and guests.</span>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a responsible restaurant owner, you must equip your kitchen with smartly engineered solutions that eliminate the smoke and cooking smells, reduce fire risks and keep the area properly ventilated at all times.</span>\n<h2><b>Smoke and Odor Issue</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nobody loves a smoky kitchen. Cooking appliances and heavy-duty <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/equipment/\">equipment</a> used in a commercial kitchen is the reason why there is so much smoke produced. The smoke contains very fine particles, which measure below 1 micron in size. Due to the fineness of the particles, the smoke can travel easily to other areas of the kitchen such as the restaurant and the bar. This causes a lot of nuisance and discomfort to those who work in the kitchen for longer hours as well as those who come to dine at your restaurant. Unless you get rid of the smoke issue, you will not only compromise the health and safety of people in your place, but it can take a toll on your business and you may be forced to ultimately close down.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cooking smell or odor has even finer particles than smoke has. It is a byproduct of cooking that goes on a large scale in a <a href=\"https://www.aps-hoods.com/services/commercial-kitchen-and-equipment-cleaning/\">commercial kitchen</a>. It takes a lot of effort to keep a kitchen smoke-free.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even after cleaning the restaurant, the residual odor remains. If you plan to operate your business in a successful manner, you should never take the odor issues lightly. The comfort and safety of your staff and guests should be the first priority. In order to get rid of the smoke and the cooking odor, you should always install an effective ventilation system that performs its job with maximum efficiency. There are multiple designs and systems to deal with such problems.</span>\n<h2><b>Grease Issue</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The buildup of grease is a very common issue in every large and busy kitchen. Grease is produced as a result of cooking with stuff such as oil, meat, fats, etc. The released grease travels into the exhaust stream, and it gathers inside the exhaust fans and the ductwork of the system.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For every high-end restaurant, it is mandatory to follow the safety regulations in regard to grease build-up. Lots of grease accumulation can increase the risk of fire in a kitchen. Too many fire accidents happen globally in restaurants simply because grease was left to gather for a long time. It is, therefore, important to install high-quality <a href=\"https://www.aps-hoods.com/services/fan-servicing/\">exhaust hoods</a> to mitigate the risks and enhance the safety of workers and visitors. As per the safety requirements, you must equip your kitchen with automatic exhaust fan controls, a <a href=\"https://www.nationwidefireprotection.com/services/restaurant-maintenance/fire-suppression-systems-fire-extinguisher-sales/\">fire suppression system</a>, and grease filters installed under the <a href=\"https://www.aps-hoods.com/all-about-exhaust-hood-system-cleaning/\">exhaust hoods</a>. All of these together will prevent the buildup of grease in different areas of the kitchen, thereby eliminating the risk of fire hazards.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hood-installed grease filters are the most important component required to prevent the accumulation of grease. Top-quality hood filters are quite efficient in the removal of the fine particles that make up grease. The amount of grease buildup depends on the type of cooking that is done in your restaurant as well as the type of cooking appliances you use in the process. High-temperature cooking appliances generate the most amount of fine particulate. That is why it is crucial that you seek the help of professionals to install highly effective exhaust hoods.</span>\n<h2><b>Invest in the Correct, High-Tech Technology</b></h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to the commercial hood and HVAC installation, you must always invest in the most advanced and ideal technology that is the best match for the type of cooking and the size of your restaurant kitchen.</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will find many exhaust hood installation companies in or near your city. Since it is going to ultimately impact your business, you should always choose to work with one that specializes in kitchen hood installation and HVAC installation. The entire process of these installations should be performed in accordance with the exact requirements of the restaurant kitchen you operate.

    "post_content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Abbreviated as HVAC, the heating ventilation and air conditioning is a common, daily use system, which provides heating and cooling. Generally, people use the term HVAC to refer to this system. The system remains installed in a wide range of residential as well as commercial buildings.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Right from the time HVAC systems were first introduced, their popularity has been on the rise continuously. This is due to their customizable design and optimum levels of comfort they offer. The main reason for the installation of the HVAC systems is that they provide warmth during the winters and coolness and freshness during summers. But these systems do a lot more than that. The HVAC also improves the air quality inside homes, offices, and buildings through filtering and maintaining the humidity level to provide a healthy and comfortable environment.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Hood Builder, we specialize in the <a href=\"/services/hvac/\">design, installation, maintenance, and repair of different types of HVAC systems for restaurants</a>. For your knowledge, we have prepared this guide, which includes information on how HVAC systems function, HVAC history, types of HVAC systems, and HVAC design as well as their installation and maintenance. So, let us dive in!</span>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>How Do HVAC Systems Work?</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though the designs of HVAC systems vary, the basic components in all of the systems are the same. Just as the acronym suggests, the system performs three key functions - heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. This is the reason why these systems have a comprehensive design. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the HVAC system stops working in your restaurant or building, you will know instantly. One of the most important functions of this system is ventilation or mechanical ventilation to be more precise. For a comfortable environment inside a commercial restaurant, apartment, or building, the exchange of air should never stop. The V in HVAC does exactly that. It moves the air inside and outside. Not only that, once the air has been drawn in, the system filters the air to make it free from dust, dirt, and allergens and provides clean and fresh air.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the quality of the indoor air has improved, the system will send it either for heating or cooling. Plus, the HVAC system will also keep the humidity in the air at an optimum level. After the air quality has been improved, the system will then direct the fresh and clean air into the home or facility.</span>\r\n<h2><b>The History of HVAC</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, we can install and use HVAC systems for comfortable living or working. But it was not like this always. Before the first version of these systems came into being, people were used to steamy summers and chilly winters. The concept for a centralized HVAC took birth in the mid-1800s.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Digging into the ancient history of Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and Chinese tell us that the very early concept of the HVAC is not new. Though these people did not actually come up with a system, they did use some techniques to keep the air cool or warm. For example, the Egyptians hung reeds in windows to make the air cool in a natural way. Later, the Greeks and Romans invented the idea of using aqueducts. This is from where the cooling and heating water pipe systems in cities were inspired. The Chinese gave the fan to the world. In the Victorian era, various aspects of unique architecture were developed for cross-ventilation.</span>\r\n<h3><b>The 1800s:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The credit for developing the modern HVAC system goes to Dr. John Gorrie. First, he put forward the idea of keeping cities cool during the summer months. Then, he designed a system to perform this specific function. With the use of cooling coils, he succeeded in bringing humidity levels under control. After getting the device patented, he further worked on finetune the system to create an automatic humidity and temperature-controlled system. </span>\r\n<h3><b>The 1900s:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Dr. John’s idea continued to improve in the decades that followed. In 1904, a refrigeration system was developed and used to cool the entire Missouri State Building. After this, the cooling and heating systems were installed in public theatres. This was a remarkable development.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Modern HVAC:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> While HVAC systems were used by commercial buildings, homeowners found it out of their budget. In 1932, H.H. Schultz and J.Q. Sherman designed an affordable unit for use in homes. The new HVAC unit was less expensive and could easily fit in window sills. After this development, the use of HVAC systems expanded in homes and apartments. By the 1960s, most homes were using at least some form of HVAC with central air conditioning.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, we have the most advanced versions of the early heating and cooling systems. The best part is that today’s HVAC can be installed in a way that it remains hidden while offering completely soundless heating and cooling. All you need to do is switch a button and the entire system starts to work.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Types of HVAC Systems</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HVAC systems have a complicated design. In fact, it is available in so many different types that choosing the right one for your restaurant or commercial building can prove to be quite daunting. Given below are some of the most common types of <a href=\"/commercial-hvac-systems-introduction-comparison-various-heating-cooling-units/\">commercial HVAC systems</a> you will come across.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Split HVAC System:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The system is so named because of the way it is installed in a commercial building. Key parts of this HVAC include air handler (indoor unit), condenser (outdoor unit), thermostat, filtration system, and ductwork. Each of these components performs a specific and important role. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Split HVAC System can be further categorized into Single-Split and Multi-Split. The Single Split HVAC is a good match for small commercial spaces such as cafes, shops and offices. The Multi-Split HVAC is designed and installed in a way that keeps all the indoor units connected to one external unit. This type of HVAC is ideal for large commercial spaces such as restaurants, large kitchens, retail shops, etc. The Multi-Split System needs to be installed by professionals because the HVAC design involves a lot of pipework and correct installation.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to have your restaurant fitted with a Split HVAC System, feel free to reach out to Hood Builders in Denver, CO. We offer professional HVAC installation for a wide range of hospitality businesses.</span>\r\n<h3><b>VR or VRF System:</b></h3>\r\n<b> </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Variable Refrigerant Volume (VRV) or Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) system is different in terms of the heating and cooling element it uses in its design. This type of HVAC uses a refrigerant and is perfect for a range of medium and large commercial spaces. The VRV system can be further categorized into Heat Pump Systems and Heat Recovery Systems.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The VR or VRF HVAC costs more than the Split HVAC. But the installation of the system is easy and quick. If the buildings have occupants, they can be set up without causing them any inconvenience. </span>\r\n<h3><b>CAV and VAV Systems:</b></h3>\r\n<b> </b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are two different types of HVAC systems. A Constant Air Volume (CAV) system uses a compressor to bring the temperature in a building to the desired level. If you operate a commercial establishment where you need constant ventilation for a long period, this HVAC system is the most suitable. The Variable Air Volume (VAV) HVAC uses a compressor for ventilation as well as to regulate the flow of the refrigerant to achieve the desired temperature level. This type of HVAC is ideal for buildings where the needs for heating and cooling are very consistent. It offers high-quality control for humidity and temperature.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The right type of HVAC for your restaurant, retail shop, or commercial building depends on what exactly your air conditioning needs.

    "post_content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The refrigerant, a chemical compound, plays a crucial role in the efficient operation of an HVAC system. You might have heard technicians often say: “Your HVAC needs a refrigerant recharge?” An air-conditioner has a non-flammable gas inside the copper coils. This is the refrigerant, which absorbs heat from the inside air of a commercial kitchen, restaurant, and other facilities that have HVAC systems installed. As the heat absorption begins, the low-pressure gas turns into a high-pressure liquid as it travels through compressors and evaporators. After its job is done, the liquid gets back to its gaseous form once again.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to understand the role of HVAC refrigerant as well as the necessity to get the recharge to avoid other issues.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>The Role of HVAC Refrigerant</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The HVAC system for its functioning relies on refrigerant. In fact, the entire cooling process revolves around this chemical.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The role of refrigerant is to first go through evaporation and then condensation. First, the compressor takes the refrigerant to a high-pressure point. As a result of this raised pressure, the chemical compound condenses and releases heat outdoors. After this, the compound evaporates to absorb heat and then deposit it outdoors. New technologies have emerged to make this entire procedure much more efficient than ever before to deliver highly effective cooling results.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the HVAC system in your facility doesn’t have the right amount of refrigerant, the AC will fail to effectively cool the property. So, it is important to keep the refrigerant level at a fixed amount at all times.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Types of Refrigerant Used in Air Conditioners</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not one type of refrigerant is used in all <a href=\"/services/hvac/air-conditioning/\">air conditioners</a>. There are multiple types of refrigerants out there. The type of refrigerant you should use depends on the type or model of HVAC system you have installed. Many new refrigerants have replaced old types of refrigerants as well.</span>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some common refrigerants are as follows:</span></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chlorofluorocarbons</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">R22</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">R410</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is never a good idea to replace one type of refrigerant with another. Recharging your HVAC unit with the wrong chemical compound can cause damage to the entire system. Since it is not possible to interchange refrigerants, you should always pay attention to the type of refrigerant you need. An easy way to find the type of refrigerant your HVAC system uses is to read the large sticker on the compressor or the evaporator of the unit. Each refrigerant has its own specific benefits and unique features in terms of efficiency, air quality, comfort, etc.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Signs Your HVAC Needs a Refrigerant Recharge</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The refrigerant is not there to be consumed by the system. In fact, the HVAC unit keeps on cycling the same quantity of refrigerant for an unlimited period of time - until the entire system breaks down.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, a recharge will be required in the event of a leak. If the HVAC technicians say your heating and cooling unit needs a refrigerant recharge, this is a major sign that there is an issue with the system. That is why the technician will first identify the location of the leak, repair it properly and then go ahead with recharging the chemical so that it doesn’t leak again. To find out whether it is time for a recharge, you should keep an eye on the warning signs.</span>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Signs your HVAC needs a recharge to include:</span></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The AC doesn’t cool the facility properly</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"/services/hvac/ventilation/\">Vent hoods</a> are blowing warm air</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Energy bills have gone up</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The refrigerant line has ice deposits</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The refrigerant lines make a hissing sound</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are running a restaurant, commercial kitchen, cafeteria, or another facility, you should always pay serious attention to the performance of the HVAC system. As soon as you spot any issues or signs, you should seek the help of a professional agency such as Hood Builder in Denver, Colorado. Our company specializes in the installation, repair, and maintenance of a wide <a href=\"/services/hvac/\">range of HVAC systems</a> to help businesses have a smooth and hassle-free operation.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are multiple reasons your HVAC refrigerant can call for a recharge. If there is a leak, it could be due to the inefficiency of one of the components of the compressor. The system may have other issues which can cause the refrigerant to leak and not function in an effective manner.</span>\r\n<h2><b>What You Should Do</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think refrigerant is leaking, you should never try to fix the problem yourself. It is the job of experts, and you should reach out to professionals for immediate help and solution to the problem.</span>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before HVAC technicians arrive, you should:</span></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Switch off the air conditioner</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turn the thermostat fan on for 2-3 hours</span></li>\r\n \t<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get in touch with technicians</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All refrigerant issues must be handled by only certified professionals. Not only is fixing the problem on your own risky, but it is also against the safety laws and regulations. Whether it is a leak repair, removal of old refrigerant, or recharging with new refrigerant, all of these must be carried out by an expert, who is qualified and certified to do the job in accordance with the law. Licensed and trained HVAC technicians will quickly identify the exact problem with the HVAC refrigerant. They will fix the problem correctly, replace the refrigerant safely and handle the equipment in a risk-free manner and restore the right level of refrigerant.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Talk to an Experienced HVAC Technician</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is essential to maintain the operational efficiency of the HVAC system in your food facility, restaurant, or kitchen. If you suspect the refrigerant is leaking, you should get in touch with trained technicians without any delay. Ignoring such issues can take a toll on the entire HVAC unit and lead to costly repairs.

    "post_content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The restaurant industry is a highly competitive one. If you plan to start a restaurant or a food service facility, you should be well-prepared to deal with a number of challenges to attract more diners and remain compliant with building and fire safety codes. Whether it is the design-build, restoration, or remodeling of a restaurant, it is important to rely only on a company that has several years of professional and qualified experience in the field. Otherwise, you might end up with a number of issues, face heavy penalties or even have to shut down business altogether.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an entrepreneur or an aspiring restaurant owner, you might ask yourself this question - “How to find a <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/design/\">professional restaurant design</a> and construction company in or near my location?” If you are in Denver, CO, you should head straight to Hood Builder for the construction of a new <a href=\"https://www.aps-hoods.com/the-definitive-guide-to-restaurant-facility-cleaning/\">restaurant facility</a> or remodeling an existing one in conformity with state laws and codes.</span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><b>Common Issues with Commercial Kitchens</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A commercial kitchen requires regular attention and maintenance. This is the space where a large volume of food preparation and cooking is done on an everyday basis. If the kitchen facility does not have an efficient and functional design, multiple problems will arise over time. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Poor Ventilation:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Production of a large amount of heat and smoke from cooking makes the kitchen atmosphere uncomfortable. When it comes to restaurant build up and design, installing an effective ventilation system is of utmost importance. A proper ventilation system will remove all the contaminated indoor air and replace it with fresh air from outside. Well-ventilated restaurants will offer comfort for the staff and attract more and more diners.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Hood Builder, we always ensure that your restaurant is designed and constructed in a way, which ensures proper ventilation and keeps the commercial kitchen free from heat, smoke, and odor.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Lack of Storage:</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Insufficient storage in commercial kitchens can lead to a great deal of chaos and take a toll on operational efficiencies. When building or <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/remodeling/\">remodeling a large kitchen or restaurant facility</a>, it is extremely important to make efficient use of the entire space, horizontal and vertical, to provide adequate storage of food items and all the necessary equipment.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a highly experienced restaurant builder, we offer restaurant designs with a lot of storage space to ensure food preparation and cooking are performed in a smooth manner without any kind of issues.</span>\r\n<h3><b>Insufficient Lighting:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If the restaurant does not get adequate natural light, you will need to install brighter LED or CFL lights. Whether it is the dining area or the kitchen itself, having a sufficient amount of light is essential. It is the job of an experienced restaurant builder to assess the specific needs of a food service facility and then come up with an effective lighting plan. Lighting does not just illuminate a space, but it also provides a warm and cozy atmosphere.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our restaurant design and remodeling services focus on lighting up a restaurant in an effective and correct manner. The right lighting will create a calm atmosphere for diners and make it easy for the staff to work. </span>\r\n<h3><b>Fire Prevention:</b></h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Fire safety and prevention is crucial part of a restaurant design project. Constant build up of grease creates a risk of fire in a commercial kitchen. You can deal with this problem by investing in an innovative fire suppression system as well as cleaning the system in a timely manner. The kitchen fire system has to be a highly active one, so as to identify the risk of a fire much before it gets a chance to spread and cause damage to people and assets.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hood Builder specializes in the installation of a wide range of fire suppression systems as per the specific needs of your <a href=\"https://www.aps-hoods.com/\">commercial kitchen</a>, cafeteria, or dining facility. Our experts will perform the entire project in accordance with the <a href=\"http://nfpa.org\">NFPA</a> fire safety guidelines to help you remain law-compliant.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If the design of a restaurant is not expertly planned, facility managers will face all these problems and many more. When setting up or remodeling a restaurant, careful attention needs to be paid to every crucial aspect of the facility. Our team of restaurant builders has extensive experience in building large food service facilities while fulfilling all the key requirements for storage, <a href=\"/services/hvac/ventilation/\">ventilation</a>, fire protection, lighting as well as all specialty equipment needs.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Restaurant Construction and Design</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building a restaurant in the United States means you will be competing with more than 650,000 other restaurants. Unless you hire a team of experts, you will have a hard time leading your business to success.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Designing a restaurant is a long and strenuous procedure.

What is important is to get the job done right - the first time around. If the remodeling of your food service facility is done wrong, you will end up wasting a lot of money as well as disrupting the business for too long. Restaurant remodeling is not just challenging, but it is also a long, step-by-step procedure. To get the desired results, you should always choose to work with a reliable renovator. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most importantly, your hired contractor and renovator should carry out the project while taking your budget into account.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remodeling the restaurant means:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Buying new tiles</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Removal of old sidings and fittings</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Planning the kitchen layout</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Changing the HVAC settings</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Revamp plumbing</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from these changes, there will be many other details that you will need to consider to achieve a customer-friendly design. You will need to discuss and plan all of these with an experienced renovator. Since remodeling means losing several precious days of your business, you should also clearly know how much time the renovation project will actually take. In any case, you will never want to drive customers away simply because you chose to remodel the facility.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are planning to remodel your restaurant facility, you should reach out to Hood Builder for the best results.

    "post_content": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fire in a commercial kitchen can prove to be devastating. Once the fire spreads to other areas, it can quickly engulf every area of the restaurant including the dining room, restroom, and entrance. As a result of this kind of damage, your business will be completely disrupted. After the smoke clears, there will be burned items and soot all over. You will not be able to resume business unless the entire restaurant is properly cleaned and restored to its pre-fire state. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is exactly where fire recovery and <a href=\"/fire-restoration/\">fire restoration</a> services for restaurants come into play. For cleaning and restoration, you will need to call in professionals who are highly experienced and skilled.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>Main Causes of Restaurant Fires</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A commercial kitchen is a place where cooking goes on for hours on end. The process of cooking and preparing a wide variety of foods leads to a buildup of grease and grime in the exhaust hood systems. Unless proper cleanup is conducted on a regular basis by professionals, the grease deposits can become a fire hazard, increasing the risk of a fire breaking out in the kitchen manifolds. Whether it is the vent hood, exhaust fan, or duct, all of these can become fire hazards.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most common causes of kitchen fires include:</span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cooking equipment (deep fryers, cooking ranges, grills)</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Electrical and lighting equipment</span></li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smoking materials</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One surefire way to prevent kitchen fires is to keep all the cooking equipment clean and grease-free. In fact, the <a href=\"https://nfpa.org/\">NFPA</a> has laid out clear guidelines which every restaurant owner needs to follow. You can minimize the risk of restaurant fire by adhering to the NFPA fire safety codes. The code requires you to keep the cooking equipment and the exhaust hood system clean.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get an inspection and find out whether your commercial kitchen or restaurant is in compliance with the current fire code, reach out to one of our specialists at the Hood Builder in Denver, Colorado. </span>\r\n<h2><b>Restaurant Fire Damage Recovery</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a restaurant sustains damage due to a kitchen fire, the business has to remain closed for several days. The more days your facility remains closed, the greater financial losses you will incur. So, the process of fire recovery, repair, and restoration needs to begin as soon as possible.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Restoration refers to the process of getting the restaurant back to the pre-fire state so that business can resume. This is a job that requires a great deal of expertise and must be performed by professionals as a result. Before restoration can start, the fire recovery expert needs to conduct an inspection of the entire facility and find out how much damage the fire has actually caused. It is crucial to find out what all cooking equipment has been damaged, what can be repaired, and what needs to be discarded. If a kitchen appliance is severely damaged and cannot be repaired and reused, you will need to have it replaced with a new one.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You may be able to get the damaged kitchen equipment and appliances repaired to restore their operational efficiency. If the equipment has sustained damage beyond repair, it will need to be replaced. Many times, it is less expensive to replace kitchen equipment than to repair it. If you take long-term benefits into account, you will find the replacement option practical. Repaired equipment and appliances will need proper testing before they can be reused.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A considerable amount of repair work will need to be performed in order for the <a href=\"https://www.aps-hoods.com/the-definitive-guide-to-restaurant-facility-cleaning/\">food service facility</a> to get back to its pre-loss condition. At the Hood Builder in Denver, CO, we specialize in restaurant fire recovery and fire restoration to help you get back on your feet in the least possible time.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Restaurant Cleaning and Restoration</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A crucial part of the <a href=\"https://www.nationwidefireprotection.com/services/restaurant-maintenance/fire-restoration/\">restaurant fire restoration process</a> is cleanup. Kitchen fire leaves ample amounts of ash and soot behind. Plus, the entire facility also smells smoky due to burning. All of this needs to be removed and cleaned in a proper manner so that the entire space gets back to its original state. The cleanup of soot and ash involves the use of different types of chemicals and cleaning agents. Fire restoration experts use special kinds of chemicals to clean and tidy up kitchen counters, range hoods, shelves, cooking equipment, kitchen appliances, etc.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is common for a burned <a href=\"https://www.aps-hoods.com/services/commercial-kitchen-and-equipment-cleaning/\">commercial kitchen</a> to also have toxic fumes that can be a health hazard. Professionals follow all the safety precautions to carry out the cleanup process in a risk-free manner.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Flooding and water damage also need proper handling. In many cases, the smoky odor does not go away even after cleaning. To deal with this, the kitchen facility needs to be repainted and resealed. Unless the commercial kitchen and all the other areas of the facility smell fresh, the job is not over. Fire restoration specialists employ multiple tools and techniques to restore the restaurant to its pristine state so that smoke and odor do not remain a recurring issue.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Commercial Kitchen Design and Construction</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Due to heavy fire damage, you may need to rebuild the entire restaurant or parts of it. When it comes to replacing or setting up new exhaust hood systems or equipment in the kitchen, expertise is a must.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hood design specialists will develop an effective plan to set up new cooking equipment and appliances. At the Hood Builder, we have an expert and highly dedicated team of engineers who will help you set up the entire commercial kitchen once again exactly as per your specific needs. Whether it is the installation of the fire suppression system or the kitchen hood design or the overall kitchen layout, our professionals will perform every job with a high level of accuracy. We provide <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/remodeling/\">kitchen remodeling</a>, <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/construction/\">restaurant general construction</a> as well as installation of fire protection systems such as Amerex, Ansul, Buckeye, and others.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more details in this regard, feel free to reach out to one of our restaurant remodeling specialists at the Hood Builder.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Collaboration with Local Fire and Health Officials</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Restoring a restaurant after fire damage requires a great deal of effort. Throughout the restoration process, the restaurant owner needs to work closely with the local fire and health officials. This is required to make the issuance of occupancy easy for the food preparation facility owner.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unless the restaurant is up to the fire safety and health codes, it is not fully ready to resume business. If you don’t have professionals by your side, keeping up with all the rules and regulations can be quite difficult. At the Hood Builder, we work in close collaboration with fire and health officials so as to ensure the entire restoration process is followed in an accurate manner. Our specialists will restore the kitchen exhaust hood system so that it is fully operational again while staying fire code compliant. Our technicians will carry out each step in a professional manner as well as share expert advice for the best results.</span>\r\n<h2><b>Get a State-of-the-Art Ventilation System</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your restaurant will not be ready to re-open unless the ventilation system is in proper order. You will either need a fire repair service or install a new ventilation system if the previous one was damaged.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proper ventilation is key to making the restaurant a safer place. After the <a href=\"/services/hvac/ventilation/\">ventilation system</a> has been correctly installed, you will need to get it cleaned by professionals on a regular basis. The vent hood and ducting need to be free from deposits of grease and grime for a fresh and safe environment. A clean and fresh environment inside the kitchen will not just minimize fire risks, but it also boosts the morale of the staff to work with a maximum level of productivity.</span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>Hire Experienced Fire Damage Restoration Professionals</b></h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Restaurant fires are both unique and devastating.

If you plan to start a food service business that allows you access to multiple locations at a time, setting up a food truck is quite a viable option. Have you seen the equipment design of a commercial kitchen? The kitchen in a food truck or trailer works quite a lot in the same manner. However, all the equipment in a food truck kitchen needs modification. Unless you have experience in how mobile kitchens in motorized vehicles work, you will have a hard time as well as make mistakes completing the entire procedure on your own.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With a<a href=\"/mobile-dining-from-chuck-wagons-modern-food-trucks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> professional food truck</a> equipment installer, the entire procedure of setting up the mobile kitchen will become easier.

Most of all, you will need to invest in the right kind and quality of equipment. For business success, the selection of the correct equipment is of utmost importance. If you end up filling your food truck with incorrect or low-quality equipment, it will ultimately have a toll on your business and one issue after another will keep arising in the future.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Given below is a list of all the different types of equipment you will need to install in your food truck or food trailer:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Cooking Equipment</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The essential equipment you will need for cooking include griddles, grills, range, microwave, charbroiler, toaster, fryer, cheese melter, etc. You will also need to install a food truck hood for the removal of grease vapors.

Examples include work tables, knife racks, frying pans, turners, food processors, etc.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Refrigeration Equipment</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Refrigeration equipment is the part and parcel of the overall equipment installation in your <a href=\"/food-truck-maintenance-what-meals-on-wheels-owners-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">food truck</a> or catering trailer. Since different food items need different levels of refrigeration, you will need to get more than just one refrigerator installed in the truck. Also, you will need to install high quality refrigeration equipment, customized as per the size and needs of your food trailer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Food truck supplies</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are short of serving supplies in the food truck, you will need to call it a day.

The license will be given only when your food truck along with all the cooking and food preparation equipment clears the inspection. The details of the food truck inspection may vary from one area to another. To make acquiring a license easy, you should reach out to the licensing agency in your area. This will help you keep the design of your food truck on the track.

The more space you have, the more functional the kitchen will be. However, this does not mean all commercial kitchens have to be big. You can also operate small kitchens while maximizing the functionality and the food service operation. Whether you want to construct a new kitchen or redesign an existing kitchen, you will need to plan everything in advance including the fire restoration for the restaurant, cooking equipment, electrical contracting, plumbing etc. It is the kitchen layout that will require the most attention.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition to the installation of all the cooking equipment, refrigerated systems and fire safety systems, you will need to make sure the kitchen workers have enough space for efficient operation and movement in the facility.

Regardless of how much space you have, the right layout can turn the space into a highly efficient and fully functional restaurant kitchen.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Restaurant contractors will present you with many different kitchen layouts to suit your specific needs. Some of the most preferred among these include Island Layout, Assembly Line Layout, Zone-style layout, Open Kitchen Layout etc. Each of these layouts is different and has something unique to offer. Before you opt for any of these, you should be crystal-clear on what exactly you are planning to achieve and what style of commercial kitchen you want to build.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you are clear as to what style you prefer, the restaurant builder will get started with the project and customize the base design in order to fulfill all the specific needs of your commercial restaurant kitchen.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>Installation of Kitchen Equipment and Systems</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before making a list of all the cooking equipment and systems for your kitchen, you will need to decide upon the menu. The selection of the kitchen equipment will depend on the type of cuisines you will serve. Main equipment required by a commercial kitchen are given below.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Cooking Equipment:</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> Buying and setting up the cooking equipment is an essential part of commercial kitchen construction services. You will need to plan out the arrangement of all the equipment in a proper manner, so that the set up does not obstruct the daily food service operation in any way. Once you have created a detailed list of all the necessary equipment, the restaurant builder will use it to draw an ideal layout for proper arrangement and function.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Refrigeration:</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> For safe storage of food items, commercial kitchens have an essential requirement for coolers and refrigerated systems. Since there are multiple types of refrigerated solutions available, you will need to choose a solution that is a perfect match for your day-to-day needs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Ventilation System:</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> Based on the type of cooking you will do, there will arise a need for the installation of a ventilation system. The heat and smoke produced in the kitchen will need removal for the safety of workers. A suitable ventilation system will ensure the indoor air quality of the commercial kitchen remains high and workers do not face any issues in regard to their health and safety.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong><a href=\"/services/hvac/air-conditioning/\">Air-Conditioning</a>:</strong> </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The success of a restaurant revolves around the functionality of its kitchen. When operating a commercial kitchen, you should take good care of the staff and provide them with a safe and comfortable environment to work in. No kitchen issue is small and it can take a toll on the productivity of the staff. That is exactly why installing a high quality HVAC system is an essential requirement for every restaurant kitchen, whether large or small.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Plumbing:</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> The safety and sanitation of a commercial kitchen is of crucial concern. When the kitchen construction layout is created, careful attention is paid to the plumbing system of the restaurant.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Fire Restoration:</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> Deposits of grease inside hoods are potential fire hazards. In any commercial kitchen, there is always the risk of fire. Kitchen fires can spread very fast and are very difficult to control. To ensure the safety of people and the entire building, the installation of a fire restoration for the restaurant is a must. At Hood Builder, we specialize in the installation, maintenance and repair of a wide range of branded fire suppression systems for large kitchens.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition to these, you may need to install many other equipment, machines and systems in your restaurant kitchen.

For more tips and advice on restaurant general construction and how the project will be carried out, do not hesitate to talk to one of our professionals.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>Storage - A Key Component of Commercial Kitchen Design</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Storage space is one of the most important components of a restaurant kitchen design. If the storage area is not adequate, it can easily hamper the overall performance of the entire kitchen. Enough storage translates to less pressure on the kitchen and more customers served. That is exactly why every restaurant owner should take this crucial part of the planning process seriously.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When building a commercial kitchen, you should plan for the following storage spaces for smooth functioning and success:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Refrigerated Storage:</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> You need to pay attention to both the amount of space as well as the location of the space. The refrigerated storage area should be close and easily accessible by the kitchen staff.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Freezer Storage:</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> A freezer room plays a crucial role in a commercial kitchen. The design and construction of the freezer room is different from other areas, as it requires the use of advanced technology. Proper storage of frozen food is paramount to the success of a commercial restaurant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Dry Storage:</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> Just like you need proper storage for fresh and frozen food items, you also need to store dry food items. Based on how much space is available, you can create dry storage in cupboards and shelves. In a small kitchen, wall mounted shelves can be used for dry storage.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Non-Food Storage:</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> In addition to food items, there are a whole lot of items and objects that need proper storage. When creating a storage space plan, you should definitely include the requirement for the storage of items such as plates, utensils, cutleries, napkins etc. Like all other storage areas, the non-food storage space should also be close as well as easily reachable.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When running a commercial kitchen, you will need adequate storage facilities for a wide range of items, objects and stuff. Plus, you will need some extra storage and some space for storing food waste. Working with experienced restaurant general contractors will make the entire process smooth and ensure that your commercial kitchen is constructed exactly as you want.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Key Aspects of Commercial Kitchen Plans</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every commercial kitchen design is unique in terms of functionality, space management and the overall functioning. However, there are some crucial aspects that are common to every restaurant kitchen. In fact, focusing on these aspects will ensure you have the most ideal kitchen constructed.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Space Efficiency:</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> One of the biggest challenges that you will need to address in kitchen design is the efficient use of the space available. So, you should define your needs in a clear manner as well as understand what are the things your restaurant must need and those that it does not need. No matter how big or small the available space is, the trick is to get the most out of it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Simplicity:</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> Based on the type of operation, the overall layout of the kitchen should have simplicity of design. Lack of simplicity will make the space look cramped, cluttered and complicated. Experienced commercial restaurant builders understand design principles and the value of simple design.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Flow:</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> Construction of an ideal restaurant kitchen involves incorporating an efficient flow throughout the entire design. This will ensure the design is both unique and functional. Lack of flow, on the other hand, will create confusion and can lead to accidents in the kitchen area. So, make sure the design of your commercial kitchen has a logical flow as per the key principles of design.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> In order to reduce carbon footprints, the construction design of the kitchen should be energy-efficient. It is not beneficial for just the environment, but it will increase your bottom line as well.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Flexibility:</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p> A commercial kitchen should be constructed in a manner that its design can adapt to changes in menu. Whether it is the cooking equipment or the refrigerated systems, it should be easy to make some adjustments in their placements according to the evolving needs of the food preparation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whether you plan a new kitchen setup or want to upgrade an existing facility, each of these aspects should be considered. Don’t hesitate to reach out to Hood Builder for detailed consultation in this regard.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>Local Codes and Regulations</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An important part of the commercial kitchen construction process is understanding and complying with the local health and safety codes. No matter how efficient, functional and attractive your restaurant design is, if it does not follow the state laws and regulatory guidelines, it will all mean nothing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When constructing the kitchen, you will need to be fully aware of the state codes, county codes and city codes. If you have a restaurant general contractor by your side, they will explain the meaning and importance of each of the codes that matters to your food service business. Though you can find many of these codes by visiting official websites, you will have a hard time understanding them unless you have an expert who can explain the codes in simple words.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For detailed information on all the local codes and regulations for running a healthy and safe commercial kitchen and to avoid any discrepancies in the future, you should consult with one of our specialists.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>Need Expert Help with the Construction of Your Restaurant Kitchen?</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you have a question or need the help of experts for the design and construction of an ideal commercial kitchen, Hood Builder is the ideal destination.

As a result of this, the workers face a number of comfort and health issues. Not only workers, but a great deal of heat in the kitchen also affects the entire restaurant. Customers are discouraged from visiting your restaurant due to poor temperature control. Diners always look for a cool and comfortable place to eat. If you plan for your business to attract more and more customers and grow, you should never ignore the kind of environment you provide to customers in your commercial restaurant.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Excessive heat and humidity often leads to a condition called heat stress in employees affecting them in several ways such as:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Difficulty to concentrate</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Muscle cramps</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Heat rashes</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Acute feeling of thirst</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Fainting</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Fatigue, nausea, vomiting</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Headache</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Heat stroke</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Being a responsible employer, you should always ensure safety and good health of all your workers as well as those who dine at your restaurant.

The HVAC or the <a href=\"/services/hvac/make-up-air/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">makeup air system</a> takes a great deal of load to perform its function.

Also, the floors do not dry fast after mopping. Such safety hazards are always the reason for slips and falls that are common in many kitchens.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Installation of Type II Condensate Hoods will help you bring the moisture and humidity in the commercial kitchen under control.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As you can see, using Type II Condensate Hoods will help you get rid of several issues in the commercial kitchen.

For your commercial kitchen and restaurant to run successfully and stay code-compliant, it is extremely important to incorporate every key feature into the overall construction and design of the restaurant.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Size&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Kitchen Size and capacity are closely related. Before the restaurant construction or remodeling project begins, it is crucial to understand the ration between the size and capacity of a restaurant. You should be clear about the number of visitors you will want the space to accommodate for dining. If you collect all the measurements in regard to visitor capacity, the design process will be easier.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That is exactly why restaurant design experts and engineers will first evaluate the specific needs of the kitchen. The capacity and the menu will be considered before everything else. It is essential to determine where doors and windows will be located and how many people will dine in the restaurant as well as what menu will be served to guests. You can never build a perfect kitchen by copying the design and layout of a generic kitchen. Though the fundamentals will remain the same, every commercial kitchen will have its own unique features.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, the most important part of a commercial kitchen construction is the arrangement of all the necessary sections and stations within the available size dimensions.

If the kitchen is ergonomically designed, it means working in it requires less movement. Using the principles of ergonomic design, professionals build the commercial kitchen in a way that requires only a minimum amount of stretching and bending. As a result of reduction in movement during work, the chances of accidents and food spilling in the kitchen are eliminated to a great extent.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most importantly, cooking and preparing food in an ergonomic commercial kitchen takes less time and effort by the staff. Operating the cooking appliances becomes very easy and without any strain to the back.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Lighting and Ventilation</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When building a large, commercial kitchen, special attention must be given to lighting and ventilation. On the one hand, adequate lighting will help the staff perform their daily tasks in a proper manner. On the other hand, proper ventilation will keep the indoor area free from heat, smoke and steam.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every commercial kitchen is a hot and smoky space. Lots of heat and smoke makes it hard for the staff to work. Contamination of indoor kitchen air makes the working environment very uncomfortable. That is exactly the kitchen you plan to construct should be well-ventilated. At Hood Builder, we provide ventilation services and equip commercial kitchens and restaurants with top quality ventilation systems to keep the indoor air quality fresh.

If accessibility is hard, the workers will face difficulty in doing the <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/cleaning/\">cleaning</a> and maintenance. Professionals will choose the most ideal flooring materials for installation in the facility. Hygiene and sanitation are extremely important aspects of a great kitchen design. If the kitchen is not easy to maintain and hygienic, the risk of food contamination will increase. This may result in food poisoning and other health issues for diners and guests. As per the food and safety regulations, you may be heavily compensated for violation or may be asked to shut down the restaurant altogether. Therefore, professional restaurant general construction services always take long-term maintenance into account.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you have a question about commercial kitchen hood cleaning, <a href=\"/services/general-contracting/grease-trap/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">grease trap cleaning</a> and kitchen hood cleaning and maintenance, feel free to get in touch with one of our experts at Hood Builder in Denver, CO.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Energy Consumption</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The way a restaurant is designed and constructed, it impacts the overall consumption of energy in the facility. Since a commercial kitchen and restaurant uses multiple systems, appliances and equipment, it is crucial to bring down energy consumption and make the facility as energy-efficient as possible.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you look at a restaurant from an energy consumption viewpoint, it is the most energy intensive business. Whether it is the cooking appliances, air conditioner, ventilation hood system or the lighting, all of this amounts to hefty energy bills.

Though cooking appliances will function for years, it is proper maintenance that will keep them in excellent condition and extend their life.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Regular maintenance means you will be able to avoid major problems. Lack of proper cleaning and maintenance will easily turn a minor issue into a major problem, requiring costly repairs and new installations.

Taking the presence and reach of social media platforms for online reviews, you should never take a risk with your business reputation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For professional maintenance, you should call in experts who understand how each part of an appliance or system functions.

It requires consideration and several important factors that control the entire process. Before the actual remodel project starts, the restaurant owner needs to know whether the kitchen will remain operational or will need to be shut down altogether. Most of all, how much time the project will take and what goals it will achieve are crucial questions planning will answer.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That is why the first thing you should define is what goals you are planning to achieve through the remodeling of the kitchen.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once you have determined the goals, you will find yourself in a better position to choose your budget and timeline for new commercial kitchen construction and redesign in a proper manner. With an experienced restaurant general contractor by your side, the entire planning phase will be carried out in a professional and accurate manner, exactly as per your daily operational needs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At Hood Builder, we provide commercial kitchen construction services, commercial kitchen redesign and restaurant remodeling services throughout Denver, CO.

Most commercial kitchen construction services will present you with three approaches. However, which approach will work best depends on the size and goals of a particular project.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Phased Construction:</strong> This approach refers to a process in which the redesign and construction of the commercial kitchen is carried out in multiple small phases rather than in a continuous manner. If you plan to have the minimum amount of disruption to your commercial operations, phased construction is the most suitable option to go for. Using this approach means there will be no requirement for complete shutdown of the restaurant and the commercial kitchen. Since some parts of the kitchen facility will remain in operation during the remodeling or redesigning work, you can still run your business on a day-to-day basis.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Full Shutdown:</strong> Based on the specific needs of the remodel project, the restaurant general contracting company may want you to completely shut down your commercial operations. Though this approach requires a great deal of planning, the approach can reduce the timeframe for the project.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Temporary Commercial Kitchen:</strong> In many cases, the best idea would be to set up a temporary kitchen in order for the commercial operations to continue uninterruptedly. The short-term kitchen can be set up in any other area of the restaurant facility. In this way, you will not need to disrupt your commercial operations or shut down the operations completely. The restaurant remodeling will be carried out in the primary space of your kitchen.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Setting up a temporary commercial kitchen will need some additional investment, but it will be worth the money and time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before the construction services of your new commercial kitchen begin, you should sit and talk to experts you hire for the job. After an assessment of your specific needs, the professionals will develop a perfect plan to carry out the renovation work. You can choose any of these three approaches as per the requirements of your day-to-day commercial operations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2420,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/The-Definitive-Guide-to-Remodeling-a-Commercial-Kitchen2-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"Restaurant equipment.

If proper planning is done ahead of time, the project will carry on and get completed in a smooth manner. The time taken to accomplish the project will depend on several factors including the scope and size of the project and availability of all the supplies and raw materials. First, restaurant general contractors will remove the old cooking appliances and fixtures before the installation of the new cabinets.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At least one week will be required to remove all the old appliances and fixtures from the commercial kitchen. Then, professionals will begin installing the new cabinets and countertops. This installation can take up 5-6 days. After this, it will be time for experts to install the new flooring.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next, all the new cooking appliances will be installed one after another. Finally, painting work will be carried out in the facility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A commercial kitchen remodel can take 4-5 weeks or more, based on the size and goals of the project.

Before you get started with the remodeling of your existing facility, you should clearly define what kind of features or characteristics you want in the new kitchen. Here are some of the key characteristics that an ideal kitchen should have.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Better Use of Commercial Space</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Depending on how many employees you have, your facility should have enough space for them to carry out their duties efficiently and comfortably. Most of all, you should make the best use of the available kitchen space. If you plan to increase the strength of staff in the near future, you should plan for the same ahead of time so that no issues arise with day-to-day operations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Energy-Efficient Appliances</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the main goals of remodeling a restaurant kitchen is to give an upgrade to the cooking equipment and alliances. In particular, you should aim to replace your old appliances with energy-efficient appliances. With experts by your side, you will be able to invest in the right type of appliances. By using energy-efficient appliances, you will not only minimize your restaurant’s carbon footprint, but you will also attract new customers who care for the environment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Resourcefulness</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>During the restaurant layout design, the contractor will carry out the installation of new cabinets and countertops to make the kitchen more resourceful. Even when the operating space is not too big, arrangement of the cabinets and countertops in an effective manner will maximize their use.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Adherence to Safety Codes</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many times, the main reason to go for a commercial kitchen redesign is to comply with the safety codes in a proper manner. When it comes to employee safety, you can never take a second chance. If your current set up does not provide a completely safe and comfortable environment for the kitchen staff, you should definitely consider giving your facility an ideal remodel. The project will focus on making the fire suppression systems up-to-date with the latest codes, improve the kitchen ventilation system and the make up air system, HVAC balancing etc.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Easy Maintenance</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Maintenance of a commercial kitchen should not be hard. Difficulty arises when the set up is not proper and up-to-date. One of the most important features of a good restaurant kitchen is its easy maintenance. If your existing kitchen takes a lot of effort and time to maintain, giving the facility a remodel will solve this problem. As a result, you will have more time to grow your business.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before the renovation project begins, you should know and define your goals with full clarity. Whether it is better working environment, efficient use of available space, making the appliances up-to-date or maximizing resourcefulness, a restaurant renovation can achieve it all.

That is why restaurant owners and facility managers always give their HVAC units proper care and attention on a regular basis. Ignoring minor issues with your HVAC systems or neglecting the maintenance can take a toll on the health of the systems. Due to poor maintenance and worn out components, the systems can also lose efficiency over time. Loss of efficiency is something that you should try to avoid at all costs because this will ultimately lead to high energy bills and increase the cost of operation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you plan to prolong the lifespan of your heating and ventilation system, you should keep an eye out for any kind of efficiency degradation due to poor maintenance and address the issues as quickly as they arise.

Though there are many different parts comprising a heating and ventilation system, one part that gets the most amount of attention is the compressor. However, problems with the system do not occur just because of a faulty compressor. If any of the HVAC unit components fails to do its job, the entire system will be affected.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The main parts that a commercial heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system consists of are as follows:&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Air conditioner</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Compressor</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Condenser</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Expansion valve</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Air Handler</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Chillers</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Roof-top units</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Duct work</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Apart from these main elements, there are several other smaller components fitted and installed in the system. The evaporator coil and the blower are together known as air handlers. Each of these components is designed to perform a specific function and together ensure overall performance of the heating and ventilation system. In order to maintain peak efficiency, you should get inspections and maintenance done without any delay or negligence. Most of all, you should get the job done by trained professionals, as these are complex machines.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At Hood Builder, we specialize in all kinds of HVAC services including HVAC balancing, HVAC installation, HVAC make up air and HVAC repair. For more details, reach out to our office in Denver, CO.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>Common Reasons Why HVAC Systems Lose Efficiency</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are operating a less efficient HVAC system, you will face multiple issues. One of the major ones among them is high energy bills. If you find that the energy consumption of your machines has been going up for the last couple of years, you should definitely consider an HVAC inspection.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Here are some of the most common causes that can lead to a loss of efficiency of commercial HVAC machines.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Clogged Air Filters</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The role of an air filter is to filter out dust and air-borne particles. In this way, the filters help the HVAC machine do its job properly. So, you should never underestimate the significance of these air filters.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As the air filters continue to do their job, they collect a lot of dust and dirt over time. Often, they get clogged after some time. Clogged or blocked air filters fail to do their job in a proper manner. As a result of too much dust, the air filters cannot adequately circulate air through the HVAC machines. If the dirty air filters are not cleaned, it becomes a reason for the equipment to lose efficiency. That is why it is crucial to not leave the air filters unchecked for a long time. Instead, you should check these parts and replace them in a timely manner.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Dirty Air Conditioner Coils</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The air conditioning unit of an HVAC machine has two coils: the evaporator coil and the condenser coil. The former is located in the indoor unit whereas the latter is located in the outdoor unit. However, these coils work in collaboration with each other in order to deliver performance. The role of the evaporator coil is to absorb the heat from the indoor air of the restaurant kitchen. The condenser coil lets out the captured heat outdoors. As a result, the indoor air in the kitchen remains cool and comfortable. But these coils can gather dust and dirt over time and fail to do the job in a proper manner. If the coils fail to do their job, the heat exchange process gets affected and the entire system can fail working as a result.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dirty air conditioner coils take away the overall efficiency of the HVAC machine. If you plan to avoid such problems, you should get in touch with an HVAC company such as Hood Builder in Denver, CO, and have technicians to service the equipment and clean the dirty coils to restor efficiency.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Dirty Furnace Burners</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The function of furnace burners is to produce heat. For this, the burners first mix fuel with air and then ignite the mixture. If the furnace burners fail to do their job properly, the heating system in your facility will be affected.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Just like filters and coils can get dirty, the furnace burners too can collect dust and dirt over time. Dust-covered burners struggle to burn the fuel or ignite in an efficient manner. Whether or not your burners are functioning correctly can be determined by using some technical methods. During an HVAC inspection or maintenance, the technician will take a closer look at the burners and see if they are clean or not. If the burners are filled with dust and dirt, cleaning will be required. Once the burners have been cleaned and re-installed, efficiency will be restored.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is not a good idea to clean the furnace burners yourself, as it can be risky. The best option is to seek the help of an HVAC company in or near your area for properly cleaning of these vital components.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Leaking Ductwork</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The ducting or the ductwork is an important part of the HVAC machine. The function of these components is to circulate cooled or heated air throughout the restaurant building. Compared to many other elements, these ducts are more prone to wear and tear and damage through use over time. Particularly, the joints along these ducts often get damaged and holes are formed. This is how the components start to leak and affect the efficiency of the entire HVAC system. Even if all the other parts of the HVAC perform well, leaky ducts can take their toll.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If your equipment has become less efficient, leaking ductwork could be one of the reasons. In order to reclaim HVAC system efficiency, the ducts will need to be repaired and sealed by a trained technician.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Dust Buildup in Motor</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>HVAC motors play a crucial role of operating the hood fans, move pumps and drive compressors. A heating and ventilation system is run by a number of different types of motors with various starting torque levels. All these motors require proper maintenance on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Over time, dust and dirt buildup degrades the functioning of the HVAC motors. Normal wear and tear takes a toll on these components. As a result, the efficiency level of the entire system goes down. Routine cleaning and lubrication are required to keep all these motors in excellent condition. When you seek the help of professionals for HVAC service, they will closely review the motors to find out if there are any issues with any of its components. The technician will replace the worn out parts with new ones in order to reclaim maximum efficiency of HVAC units.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you are in search of an HVAC company in Denver, CO, Hood Builder is the right place for all kinds of HVAC-related services as well as hood installation and ventilation services. Plus, our company provides hood cleaning, commercial kitchen construction and fire protection system installation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3><strong>Aging HVAC Equipment&nbsp;</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Commercial HVAC systems are designed to control heat and temperature and provide a safe and comfortable working environment for the employees as well as the visitors to the facility. No matter what type of heating and air conditioning equipment you have, its performance will decrease over time, as it becomes old. There are various factors that can expedite or slow down the aging of the HVAC units. When you hire a contractor or restaurant construction services, you should first invest in a high quality HVAC system that is most ideal for your daily needs.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At the same time, you should give each HVAC unit timely and proper maintenance to prevent early equipment aging.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On an average, the lifespan of a furnace is 15-20 years whereas an air conditioning unit can last for up to 15 years. The lifespan of a heating and ventilation system depends on the type, model, local environmental conditions and the use of the machines on a day-to-day basis. Even after maintenance, old age will finally kick in and your equipment will become less efficient over time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Of all the components that an HVAC system is composed of, some parts will last as long as the lifespan of the equipment while others will be prone to wear and tear. For example, mechanical or moving components will suffer wear and tear, subject to the condition of the lubricant. The refrigerant is one part that can last for a long time, probably throughout the life of the equipment. You should remain aware of all the key parts and components and understand what kind of maintenance your system needs to keep all parts in excellent condition. With timely management, you will be able to avoid many of the problems due to which your equipment can age faster. Just keep a close watch on the performance of the system.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is always best to regularly monitor the performance of your HVAC systems so that you can maintain good equipment health.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>At Hood Builder, we perform high quality HVAC installation by trained professionals as well as provide <a href=\"/services/air-balancing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">air balancing HVAC</a>, fire protection installation, air conditioning units, range hood installation, make up air system, fire suppression system and many other commercial restaurant equipment services.

One of these is the use of oil additives. Thanks to the advancement in the field of material science, oil additives can be used to coat the surface of your HVAC machines in order to increase resistance to daily wear and tear. Likewise, there are other additives to reduce energy consumption and boost the overall efficiency of the heating and air condition machines installed in your facility. Use of additives along with monitoring tools to keep track of the performance are effective ways to extend the lifespan of your commercial HVAC machines and equipment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2><strong>Still Have a Question?</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>HVAC units are complex and sophisticated machines.

This can deteriorate the indoor air quality and create safety and health issues for the employees as well as those in the dining area.

It should always be done by someone with adequate expertise and skills.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A trained professional will first ask you when was the last time you got hood exhaust cleaning done.

Apart from adhering to the building codes, you should also need to give your exhaust hoods proper maintenance on a regular basis.

    "post_content": "A commercial kitchen produces smoke, steam and grease on a large scale. All these contaminants make the indoor air impure. If these impurities are not removed on a constant basis, the risk of potential safety hazards in the kitchen increases. Not just the commercial kitchen, but it poses risks for the employees, guests and the restaurant building as well. That is why it is crucial to set up a proper ventilation system in every restaurant and commercial kitchen. Thanks to technological advancements, you will find some of the most ideal solutions to keep your entire facility well-ventilated at all times while providing enhanced protection against the danger of fire. It is only that you should select and invest in the right type of commercial kitchen ventilation system, get it installed right and give it good maintenance.\n\nSo, let us discuss why it is important to outfit your restaurant kitchen with an ideal <a href=\"/services/hvac/ventilation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">commercial kitchen ventilation system</a> and what key benefits proper ventilation has to offer for business owners.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1-800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\n\n<h2><strong>Health and Safety</strong></h2>\nWhen you operate a commercial kitchen, you should see to it that the work environment for the staff is healthy and safe. Hot and smoky air contaminates the indoor air and makes the atmosphere stifling. It becomes hard for employees to breathe in hot and impure air inside the kitchen. Due to poor ventilation, the staff will have to deal with a buildup of carbon monoxide, which can lead to a range of respiratory illnesses. All these issues together can make working for the employees quite difficult. No one would want to work in an unsafe and unhealthy environment.\n\nIt’s not just the kitchen area, but the hot, smokey and grease-laden air will also travel to other areas of the restaurant. If you plan to avoid any kind of health or safety issues in your restaurant, you should install a proper ventilation system with well-designed kitchen exhaust hoods.\n\nIf you have a question or need expert advice on enhancing safety for your workers and guests, feel free to reach out to Hood Builder and talk to one of our commercial kitchen ventilation specialists in Denver, CO.\n<h2><strong>Regulatory Compliance</strong></h2>\nWhen you install a ventilation system in your commercial kitchen, you should follow all the regulatory guidelines and codes put forth by <a href=\"https://www.nfpa.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">NFPA</a>. Setting up a ventilation system is not just about selecting exhaust hoods that will vent the air. In fact, you need to take several key factors into account.\n\nou should consider these important factors:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Type of cooking you do</li>\n \t<li>Type of cooking equipment and appliances you use</li>\n \t<li>Placement of your cooking appliances</li>\n \t<li>Positioning of the exhaust hoods</li>\n \t<li>Design of the ventilation system</li>\n</ul>\nAll commercial kitchen hoods are not designed equal. When it comes to the installation of a vent hood system, you should assess what your exact needs are and then choose the right type and design of the system in order to keep the kitchen area clean, fresh and well-functioning at all times.\n\nAccording to the local and national fire safety codes, you should install the right type of exhaust hood (Type I or Type II). More importantly, you need to choose the exhaust hoods as per the exhaust rate that your facility will need. You need to abide by all the kitchen layout requirements. Non-compliance of any of the ventilation codes can have serious consequences. The NFPA has formulated these regulatory guidelines to enhance the safety of people and properties. If you violate these guidelines in any manner, you will be liable to pay hefty fines as punishment. Worse still, you may even have to deal with serious legal tussles with the concerned authorities or shut down your restaurant business altogether.\n\nFor a layman, it can be very difficult to understand all the ventilation codes. Plus, these safety codes vary from one location to another. You will need the help of an expert to correctly interpret the meaning of the kitchen ventilation regulations and then comply with all of them in a proper manner. If you operate a commercial kitchen in Denver, CO, you should head straight to Hood Builder and consult your specific needs with one of our kitchen ventilation specialists.\n<h2><strong>Energy Efficiency</strong></h2>\nWhen you operate a restaurant kitchen, one of the key challenges you need to deal with is to reduce energy consumption. Here, the role of an HVAC system or vent hood system becomes even more important. Restaurants and commercial kitchens are known for high energy consumption. You can reduce your energy consumption by investing in the right ventilation system.\n\nUnlike residential kitchens, commercial kitchens generate a huge amount of heat, smoke and grease. The indoor air becomes hot and it puts pressure on the ventilation systems as a result. If the cooking appliances you use are low-efficiency, the situation can be worse. The more heat you have in the kitchen, the more your ventilation systems will need to work. Ultimately, you will see the energy consumption shoot up month after month. One surefire way to address this problem is to install the type and design of the vent hood system. You can seek the help of experienced professionals to develop highly optimized designs for the <a href=\"/services/hvac/air-conditioning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HVAC system</a>.\n\nWhen designing an HVAC system, the most focus should be on the exhaust hood air flow. Being an essential component, it takes energy consumption to a higher level for CKV. If the ventilation is performed properly, you will see a reduction in your energy consumption. An exhaust hood is not a simple metal box. Contrary to the general perception, different hoods operate at different capture and containment airflow. So, always install high efficiency hoods.\n\nIn order to reduce high energy bills, you should focus on optimization of all the <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/equipment/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">kitchen equipment</a> and machinery. Most of all, you should hire experts to design a ventilation system that is ideal for the type of cooking you do. The exhaust hood air flow must be reduced for higher energy efficiency. The air distribution system should be designed in a manner that avoids cross-drafts. For more details on energy-efficient kitchen ventilation design, feel free to discuss your specific needs with a commercial kitchen ventilation expert at Hood Builder in Denver, CO.\n<h2><strong>Maintenance and Cleaning</strong></h2>\nPost-installation of the commercial kitchen ventilation system, you need to give it proper care and maintenance on a regular basis. As a responsible restaurant owner or facility manager, it is your responsibility to see to it that the vent hood system is properly maintained and cleaned. By doing so, you will stay compliant with the regulations and guidelines. The Food Hygiene Regulations also make it compulsory for restaurant owners to keep the vent hood system clean. All of this will help you keep the occupants and the entire building safe.\n\nIt can be hazardous to ignore the maintenance of the ventilation system in any manner. In fact, you should always pay attention to proper <a href=\"/services/restaurant-services/cleaning/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">maintenance and cleaning</a> of the vent hood system. From everyday maintenance and regular cleaning to annual inspections testing and deep cleaning, you should seek the help of highly trained technicians for proper degreasing and odor removal.\n\nLack of proper maintenance will take its toll on the exhaust hoods and the commercial kitchen air quality will be affected. If the system gets clogged with particulate matter, the air flow will be interrupted. Over time, the duct work will get blocked entirely creating potential safety hazards. Moreover, the indoor kitchen will not be fresh and clean due to the poor efficiency of the system. It is crucial that you don’t let grease and other particulate matter deposit inside the ductwork by properly taking care and cleaning of the entire kitchen ventilation hood system.\n\nIt is important to understand that everyday cleaning by the staff will not eliminate the need for detailed cleaning. You should create a schedule as per the specific needs of your commercial kitchen to deep-clean every part of the ventilation system including the canopy, grease filters, range hoods, exhaust hood fans etc. Plus, you should carry out the maintenance tasks exactly as per the code by NFPA requires in order to avoid any kind of code violation. Odor problem arises from poor maintenance and cleaning of the HVAC system. If you plan to keep the kitchen as well as the dining area free from odors and smells, you should carry out proper and regular cleaning and maintenance of the entire ventilation exhaust hood system.\n\nWhen carrying out the maintenance, you should follow the key requirements that includes inspecting and testing the extract, recirculation and supply. There are specific requirements for the general maintenance of each of these units. For inspection and deep cleaning, you should work with an experienced and specialist contractor in or near your location. If you are in Denver, CO, Hood Builder is an ideal destination for knowing all kitchen ventilation regulations and professional kitchen ventilation cleaning to remain code-compliant and enhance safety.\n<h2><strong>Choosing the Right Ventilation System</strong></h2>\nThe main role of a ventilation system is to constantly replace hot and smoky air in the kitchen with fresh and clean air. By removing contaminants from the indoor air, these vent hood systems create a safe and comfortable environment for the staff and a fine dining experience for guests. Since all ventilation systems are not the same, you should select a type and design that is ideal for your commercial kitchen. Here are some useful tips to help you select the right one.\n<h2><strong>Kitchen Size and Layout</strong></h2>\nBoth the size and the layout of a commercial are important considerations for selecting the ideal ventilation system. Your air replacement and air flow requirements, depend on the size of your restaurant kitchen. The layout will determine how exactly the exhaust hoods will be installed and placed. Professionals will first evaluate the exact needs of your commercial kitchen and then determine the right solution for proper ventilation throughout the kitchen and dining area.\n<h2><strong>Types of Cooking Equipment</strong></h2>\nIn a commercial kitchen, there are different types of heavy-duty, industrial cooking equipment and machinery. What type of ventilation system will be needed depends on the type of equipment you use in your kitchen. If you have commercial deep fryers and grills in your cooking facility, you will need a vent hood system that can throw out greasy air quickly and efficiently. Range hoods will be installed just above the cooking equipment and appliances in the kitchen.\n<h2><strong>Hood Code Regulations</strong></h2>\nThe device that is installed right above a cooking equipment or appliance is called exhaust hood or range hood. When choosing a ventilation system, you should follow all the kitchen hood requirements, as per regulatory guidelines. You need to abide by both national and local hood including the design, layout and type of hoods as well as grease and condensation filtration guidelines.\n<h2><strong>Specific Ventilation Requirements</strong></h2>\nYou may have some specific ventilation requirements in your restaurant or food service establishment, in addition to other factors mentioned above. If you don’t have windows in the kitchen or if you have a need to tackle some specific air-borne contaminants, you must take these factors into account.\n\nEvery commercial kitchen has its own unique needs. It is crucial to assess the exact needs of your restaurant and understand other specific circumstances that you may have to deal with. With highly experienced professionals by your side, you will be able to understand your specific needs in an accurate manner and then choose a ventilation solution that is a perfect match.

When talking about HVAC maintenance, you should never ever forget about the importance of air balancing. In fact, air balancing HVAC is one of the most crucial parts of the overall maintenance of the ventilation system fitted in a restaurant or commercial kitchen. This is important because doing so offers several key advantages. It includes enhancing comfort and efficiency inside the commercial building or facility.

But what exactly does it mean to air-balance an HVAC system?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In simple terms, HVAC balancing refers to the maintenance and repair of the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning system in order to make sure the entire system evenly distributes conditioned air throughout a commercial property or facility. As a result of this, uneven temperatures inside the property come down. Whether you operate a hotel, restaurant, or cafeteria and have an HVAC system installed in the facility, things can go wrong or issues may arise. If you plan to maximize the operation efficiency of the system, you should work with specialists to test, adjust, and balance the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system. The purpose of air-balancing HVAC is to improve airflow within the facility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Once the air-balancing has been completed, you will start to see and experience all the benefits it has to offer. The frequency of the task depends on what kind of issues you are having with your HVAC system. Usually, the system needs to be balanced when it is first installed and set up. After that, it will be required when you face the problem of uneven temperature in your facility.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Causes of Imbalance in the HVAC System</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The big question is: What leads to an unbalanced HVAC system? Of course, HVAC needs balancing when there is an imbalance. There are multiple causes of an imbalance in the HVAC system, but it can be found out by experts only after a detailed assessment of the specific problem.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before the process of balancing the HVAC system can begin, professionals will conduct an evaluation to discover the exact issue that has caused the imbalance. Since this is a highly technical job, experts use a variety of equipment and tools to properly check all the ducts or vents that comprise the system. There are three things in particular that the technicians check. These include the pressure and speed of the airflow and the fluctuations in the temperature.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Poor Airflow</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you suffer from poor airflow and uneven temperature, it could happen due to a number of reasons. Many times, such an issue comes up simply because the ductwork was not properly installed. Setting up an HVAC system involves a number of crucial processes, which should be completed with accuracy. If you work with inexperienced or novice technicians, they may install ducts and vents that are not the ideal size for the facility or building. In that case, the airflow and the air quality as a result will be affected. Another common cause of an imbalance in the HVAC system is worn-out or damaged ducts and vents. Filters of the wrong size or thickness can also be the cause of an unbalanced HVAC system.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To find out more about the causes of an unbalanced HVAC system, you should reach out to one of our experts at Hood Builder in Denver, CO.

For the heating ventilation and air-conditioning system to work with full efficiency, balanced air is a prerequisite. Any kind of imbalance will change the air quality and the temperature.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first sign you can use to identify an unbalanced HVAC is the fluctuations in the level of the indoor temperature. People or employees in a commercial facility start to complain about excessive cold or hot areas in the facility. If you operate a commercial kitchen or restaurant kitchen, the number of complaints by the staff in such scenarios will continue to increase. However, this is not the only sign of imbalance in AC balancing, air duct balancing, airflow balancing, etc. Poor indoor air quality is also an indication of this problem. For example, indoor air that feels bad is one of the signs of an unbalanced HVAC system. Due to an imbalance, the HVAC system may shut down immediately. If the issue is not fixed in time, the electricity bill will continue to increase. Apart from these, there are many other signs too.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">signs of an imbalance in the HVAC system</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Some of the most common signs of an imbalance in the HVAC system in a commercial building, facility, or restaurant kitchen include:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Rise and fall in temperature levels from room to room</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Unexplainable increase in electricity bills</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Deteriorating indoor air quality</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>High levels of humidity</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Mold growth</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Uncontrolled condensation</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the HVAC system is unbalanced, you may hear health-related complaints from your workers and staff as well. If your employees start to take more sick leaves than before, you should consider the matter seriously. An increase in sick day absences may arise due to poor indoor quality, which in turn, may arise from an imbalance of the heating ventilation, and AC system.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If you experience any of the above-mentioned signs with the functioning of your commercial HVAC system, talk to one of our experts at Hood Builder in Denver, CO, and discuss the issues in detail.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1-800-750-7055\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (800-750-7055)</a></p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhance Comfort and Efficiency with HVAC Balancing</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Balanced air simply translates to comfort and efficiency.

These kitchens are large and generate a great deal of heat, steam, and smoke. If the HVAC system doesn’t function efficiently, the indoor air quality will be badly affected. The ventilation system needs to ventilate the kitchen area by bringing in fresh air from outside in a proper manner. If the air balance is improper, the air quality inside the facility will continue to suffer. It will create issues for the employees to do their jobs comfortably. It is crucial to keep the indoor temperatures at the optimum level and the indoor air fresh. That is exactly what a well-balanced HVAC system does.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whether it is the hot summer months or the winter season, you need to ensure the work environment inside your commercial building or facility remains comfortable and healthy at all times.

Its purpose is to remove airborne grease, combustion products, fumes, smoke, heat, and steam from the air by effectively evacuating and filtering them.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How effective is the kitchen hood?</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As per findings from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), the typical capture efficiency of standard hoods ranges from 30-40% on front burners and can reach as high as 90% on back burners.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How many types of main kitchen hoods are there?</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are different kitchen hood styles to choose from, including under-cabinet, wall-mount canopy, island canopy, hood liners, retractable downdraft, and microwave hood combinations.

The size of your range determines the required CFM. If your range is against a wall, consider a wall hood, under-cabinet hood, or range hood insert. For a range on a kitchen island, use an island hood.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What are the different types of hoods in the industry?</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are three main types of hoods: Enclosing hoods, Receiving hoods, and Capturing hoods.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What is a professional hood?</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Commercial-grade residential hoods, known as professional range hoods, are designed to fit perfectly over even the largest ranges.

Most people think of sprinklers, extinguishers, and other tools to counter a fire threat. The reality of the situation is different, and <strong>kitchen hood </strong>can at least affect how often we have to deal with fires.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like many other incidents and disasters, a fire can be prevented and managed long before a disaster.

We will also discuss some tips on ensuring you get the most out of your ventilation system. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center call-to-action\"><strong>We can provide help in a variety of restaurant services including ventilation in Colorado, don’t hesitate to call <a href=\"tel:+1-303-777-7720\">303-777-7720</a> for a free quote</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Get to Know the Labels</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before we get to the effect of a <strong>range hood</strong> and <strong>kitchen stove hood</strong> on a fire, first we briefly mention the different ways a fire could erupt. Aside from common sense, there are many sources provided by the <a href=\"/\">NFPA</a>, that can help us identify and prevent danger.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Understanding the <strong>NFPA diamond</strong>, also called <a href=\"https://www.nfpa.org/codes-and-standards/7/0/4/nfpa-704\"><strong>National Fire Protection Association 704</strong></a>, gives us a lot of edge when dealing with fire and its prevention. The labels give information about the different materials you might have in your kitchen and how dangerous they can be.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You don’t need to memorize the exact number of <strong>National Fire Protection Association Labels</strong>, for every single chemical. Labeling the chemicals and the solutions you use in your kitchen is enough. It is just a precaution so you’d know what to keep away from fire.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Helps You Prevent Fire?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Let’s start simple. Take a look around the kitchen and check your cookers. Grease only helps to spread and increase the intensity of a fire. What sparks it though? Well, a spark of course! After working for long hours every day, you might get so tangled up in the work that you forget regular safety checks.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The grease build-up is the nightmare of every chef, restaurant owner, health inspector, and especially the fire marshal. Let's just say it doesn’t really “help” in preventing a fire hazard. Naturally, neglecting the cleaning puts your kitchen at risk of many incidents, including fire.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Check the Back!</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Don’t limit the regular maintenance and checking to what you see. Try to check all the connections to the gas pipes and make sure they are in top shape since even a small leak can turn into a disaster. A proper ventilation system might help with the smell but it won’t solve the issue.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don’t Forget the Electricity&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A <strong>fire hazard </strong>might be misleading in its name.&nbsp; It reminds us of gas, oil, or smoke. The reality is that the source of many fires can be traced to bad or old wiring and electrical equipment. This is why you should always put devices and wiring maintenance in your schedule.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Corrosion can be your worst enemy when it comes to the wiring and the equipment. The wires eventually start to heat up when exposed to electricity and might, in the best-case scenario, pop a circuit, or even cause a fire if sensitive material is nearby.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Make Sure You’re Ready</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Although we always try to minimize the chances of an incident from happening, it is always recommended to be prepared for when things get out of hand. Equipping your kitchen with proper fire alarm systems, smoke detectors, sprinklers, and <a href=\"/services/fire-suppression-systems/installations/\">fire suppression systems</a> is a must for every owner.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How does a <strong>kitchen hood</strong> help prevent fire?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Before a fire erupts, there are many signs and conditions to be met for a disaster to happen. One of which is poor ventilation of air. The grease particles floating in the air from all the cooking must land somewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Installation of a <strong>stove ventilation hood</strong>, in addition to the airflow of the kitchen, helps reduce the build-up of grease in your work area. This results in fewer accidents in your kitchen, however, <a href=\"/services/hoods/cleaning/\">cleaning the <strong>kitchen exhaust hood</strong></a><strong> </strong>should also be a top priority to keep the equipment running smoothly.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The <strong>ventilation hood </strong>is for many, sufficient for reducing the airborne grease, however, to help reduce the headache of cleaning the venting system and also the costs, some may turn to <a href=\"/services/hoods/shepherd-disposable-grease-filters/\">grease filters</a>. This helps owners save time, money, and resources.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This filtration of the air and cleaning of the airborne grease particles implicitly reduces the threat of fire by decreasing the build-up. However, you will need to tend to the <strong>stove exhaust hood </strong>as well, just to keep it clean and running smoothly for years to come.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keeping the Temperature Low</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Aside from all the grease, fumes, carbon monoxide, and gasses that the <strong>kitchen ventilation hood </strong>vents out of your environment. One important aspect of its work is to bring down the temperature. This can help you cook easier and naturally, by decreasing the temperature, it lowers the chances of incidents related to heat from happening.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Maintaining the Airflow</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Keeping the air fresh has many benefits. Aside from venting out unpleasant smells and providing comfort while cooking. A <strong>stove hood </strong>can come in handy with smoke, gasses, and any other dangerous fume that needs to be ventilated. Remember that you need all the help you can get in a <strong>fire hazard.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center call-to-action\"><strong>If you are a restaurant owner in need of assistance in Colorado, \n call <a href=\"tel:+1-303-777-7720\">303-777-7720</a> for professional advice about the best equipment suited to your needs.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Does the variety matter?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Simply searching for a <strong>kitchen hood </strong>shows you hundreds of results for different types, models, shapes, and prices. This variety proves that there must be a difference between the different types of <strong>ventilation hoods.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most of the time these differences are related to the design that the customer has in mind. It is just a matter of taste and decoration. This of course affects the price but what about efficiency? Which model is best for our kitchen? Let’s look at the two main types of <strong>range hoods.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Ducted Range Hood</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The most common type of <strong>kitchen ventilation hood </strong>and the one you probably use. Connected to a vent, the air flows through the stainless-steel baffles and filters and exits the building. External ventilation offers more safety in vacuuming out the smoke and dangerous fumes.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Because of its efficiency, this is usually the top choice of most kitchens and restaurants. There is no need for constant cleaning of the filters and since a commercial kitchen is a busy place, a ducted range hood is simply a better option.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li>Ductless Range Hood</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Offering versatility in placement, the <strong>ductless range hood </strong>filters and recirculates the air back into the environment. This usually requires more fan power. This is not very efficient when it comes to saving energy and time, since the filters need constant cleaning to work properly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The presence of carbon monoxide, formaldehyde (a chemical produced by heating oil), chemical cleaners, and other gasses and fumes inside a kitchen; especially a commercial kitchen where there is constant cooking, rules out the option of having a <strong>ductless range hood</strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:table -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Ducted Range Hood</td><td><strong>Ductless Range Hood</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Provides external ventilation&nbsp;(safer for certain environments)</td><td>The air recirculates back to the building&nbsp;(after passing filtration)</td></tr><tr><td>Great for places where lots of smoke, fumes, or gas is generated</td><td>There is no need for ducts or pipes, so you can place it anywhere you want.</td></tr><tr><td>claimed to be more silent and efficient</td><td>Most models have timers and can be controlled automatically</td></tr><tr><td>Has limits when it comes to placement(needs a duct vent)&nbsp;</td><td>The filter requires regular cleaning and replacement</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>\n<!-- /wp:table -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are always other factors such as the size, the power, the energy usage, etc. Which you need to consider. That is why it is important to look for the help of a professional when installing a <strong>kitchen hood.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ventilation in Crisis</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An important aspect of any fire hazard, besides the flames, is the smoke. Although various extinguishers, sprinklers, and fire protection equipment can save you from fire, it is the <strong>kitchen fume hood </strong>and the ventilation system that save you from suffocation.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Flames take a while to spread throughout the building. Smoke, however, doesn’t need more than 5 minutes to fill the entire place. What is important is to make sure you buy every second you can get, by providing a functional and efficient ventilation system.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Public safety is another important reason to install a decent ventilation system. The <strong>kitchen ventilation hood </strong>purifies the air from smoke, gas, and dangerous fumes, which gives you and your staff that extra edge to evacuate the building and minimize injuries and losses.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is the point that having a <a href=\"/services/hvac/ventilation/\">proper HVAC system</a> comes in handy, as it can be a valuable tool in increasing the airflow and venting out smoke and gas.&nbsp; Comfort is just one of the many qualities of having a functional HVAC system. Safety is the most important of those qualities.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Installation Matters</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As previously mentioned, the first line of defense for safe evacuation and fire prevention is equipping your kitchen with a functional and clean <strong>kitchen hood</strong>. <a href=\"/services/hoods/installation/\">Installation of a <strong>range hood vent</strong></a><strong> </strong>can be overwhelming without the help of technicians and professionals. </p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Efficiency is the key.

In general, the types include water sprinklers, clean agents, chemical agents, and carbon dioxide systems.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Water-based System:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is the most common suppression system because of its fair price and availability of water. This system uses pipe networks to send and distribute water to the connected sprinkler bulbs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Since the fire system must be chosen according to the type of fire, water sprinklers can not be used for gas and oil fires. Moreover, water-sensitive properties may be seriously damaged after activation. Fire sprinklers have four types of <a href=\"https://www.nfpa.org/news-blogs-and-articles/blogs/2021/03/26/sprinkler-system-basics-types-of-sprinkler-systems\">wet pipe, dry pipe, pre-action, and deluge</a>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Clean Agent System:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It uses chemical agents or inert gas to suppress fire. Its extinguishing agents are safe enough to be used in crowded places. The life span of this hazard system is quite short.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Chemical Agent System:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>They are waterless and also electrically non-conductive. There are wet and dry chemical agents. Wet chemical systems are efficiently used in commercial kitchens. The liquid spray reacts with the oils and fats on the burning surface to produce foam. Dry chemical systems use chemical powder to extinguish fire. They actually suffocate the flames.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Carbon Dioxide System:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This system can be used in large open areas or even for a single piece of equipment. Carbon dioxide lacks electrical conductivity, odor, and color; so, no need to worry about the cleanup after the activation. This type of system does not even damage delicate items.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Most Suitable Suppression System for Food Trucks</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As talked about before, most <a href=\"/services/food-trucks-design-fire-suppression-installation-services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">snack truck operators</a> have to equip their businesses with efficient fire suppression systems.

It uses a chemical agent to suppress and cool down the fire.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When the fire starts, it is detected automatically and then the chemical is released throughout the hood and on the appliances. The liquid spray reacts with fats and oils and produces foam. This foam prevents fire reignition.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Besides, after the fire hazard, all the surfaces and appliances can be cleaned easily.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A dry chemical system provides a perfect fire attack. It uses dry chemical powder which is pressurized into a large tank. This system can be easily installed in any commercial kitchen. It is cheap and you can simply use it when there are not any water resources available.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An important point to be mentioned is that after each operation you must re-fill the tank.

A Wall-Mounted Range Hood:&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Have you got your stove against the wall? So, a wall-mounted range hood is exactly what you need for that setup. This hood typically has a canopy that covers the <a href=\"/services/hoods/fans/\">filters and fans</a>. It also has a chimney that extends up to the ceiling.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;The canopy hangs above the cooking area to keep the air clean and fresh while you cook. The canopy is usually made of stainless steel; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; however, it can have other materials like glass or copper.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A wall-mounted range hood draws in the air through filters to capture grease and other particles. Then it either recirculates clean air back into the kitchen or sends it outside through ducts.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;It usually comes with multiple fan speeds to adjust the airflow according to your needs. Moreover, most wall-mounted hoods have built-in lights to brighten up your cooking space.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;Controlling this type of hood is a breeze with simple buttons on the front. You can adjust the fan speed, turn on/off the lights, and even set a timer for automatic shutoff.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To ensure the hood operates properly and efficiently, regular maintenance is needed. This maintenance involves cleaning or replacing filters, wiping down the exterior surfaces, and checking for any blockages in the ducts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. An Under-Cabinet Range Hood:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;It is a practical space-saving ventilation system that sits under a cabinet above your stove or cooktop. As the same as other hoods, it is used to remove heat, smells, grease, and smoke during cooking.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These hoods come in all shapes and sizes to fit your kitchen setup and cooking needs. They help to save space and provide efficient ventilation. They are like the cool compact cousin of those big range hoods you can see in fancy kitchens.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The same as a wall-mounted range hood, an under-cabinet range hood also has a metal canopy that houses a fan and filters. The fan captures whatever is needed and then gives out the clean fresh air back into the kitchen or sends it outside through ductwork.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You can control this range hood with simple buttons or touch controls on the front panel. Whenever you need more airflow, or some extra light over your stove, or you want to turn the fan on/off, just hit the button.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Remember! Proper maintenance is the key to ensuring the lifespan and optimal performance of your range hood. Regularly <a href=\"https://www.nationwidefireprotection.com/services/restaurants-maintenance/kitchens-equipment-cleaning/\">clean or replace the filters</a>, wipe down the surface, and check for any clogs in the ducts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3.&nbsp;An Island Range Hood:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This hood is not just a functional appliance, but also a touch of elegance to your kitchen. An island range hood hangs over your kitchen island and acts as the rock star of the kitchen.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>These hoods are designed for kitchens with cooktops or ranges located on an island rather than against a wall. They typically hang from the ceiling above the cooking area, creating a focal point that is all about looking good and getting the job done.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Island range hoods have different shapes and sizes to match your kitchen decor and meet your ventilation needs. Some have a classic canopy design with inside fans and filters while others have a sleek glass or stainless steel finish.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The main function and also the maintenance of this type of range hood are exactly similar to the previously mentioned ones.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Control options for island range hoods can vary from simple buttons to touch screens or even remote controls. Many models also come with built-in lighting to brighten up your cooking area and set the mood.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. A Downdraft Range Hood:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;This type of hood is a ventilation system that sits directly beside or behind your cooktop or stove. A downdraft hood pulls cooking odors, steam, and smoke downward and sends them out of your kitchen through some ductwork.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The cool thing about this kind of hood is that it does not take up a ton of space. It provides a clean and modern look for the kitchen. As a result, it is perfect for kitchen islands or open-concept setups with limited space.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are two types of downdraft range hoods. Retractable ones can be hidden when not in use and can be raised whenever needed. Pop-up ones rise from the countertop at the touch of a button.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Remember! A space-saving downdraft range hood may not be as efficient and powerful as other big overhead hoods. Just ensure to choose the right size and install it properly to get its optimal performance.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. A Ducted Range Hood:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This vented range hood captures air and odors through its powerful fan and then expels them outside through a duct. Its filters also capture grease and other particles.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A ducted range hood has a system of pipes or channels to connect the canopy, which is installed above the stove/cooktop, to the outside of your kitchen. This ductwork prevents the air from recirculating back into the kitchen.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A ducted range hood is highly efficient in removing all the cooking byproducts and preventing the build-up of grease and cooking smells in the kitchen. So, this makes it a popular choice for those who prioritize clean and odor-free kitchens.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For this superhero to work its magic, <a href=\"/services/hoods/installation/\">proper and professional installation</a>, and<a href=\"/services/hoods/cleaning/\"> regular maintenance</a> are crucial.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. A Ductless Range Hood:&nbsp;</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This one is a reliable sidekick for your kitchen. It battles your kitchen's grease, and odors by recirculating the air back into the kitchen after filtering it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The filters of the hood which are usually made of charcoal or carbon grab grease and smell as the air passes through. After the air gets filtered, a fan inside the hood kicks the clean and fresh air back into the kitchen.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A ductless range hood is most suitable for kitchens where setting up ductwork is impossible or too pricey. It is also more energy-efficient since they do not need to push air outside.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. A Custom Range Hood:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>&nbsp;This type of hood is not only functional but also something unique and tailored to fit your kitchen's style, layout, and needs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When a custom range hood is your suitable choice, you have the freedom to choose every detail from the material to the shape and also size of the hood. You can decorate your range hood with fancy carvings, stylish trims, or even built-in lighting.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This highly efficient type of range hood also gives you the freedom to choose your most suitable ventilation system. You can pick the ducted type to blow air outside or the ductless type to recirculate clean air back into the kitchen with the help of its powerful filters.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In summary, a custom range hood is not just a boring appliance. It can be a standout piece that adds personality and style to your kitchen while making sure things stay fresh and clean.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Note that to bring your vision to life and create a custom range hood that is both awesome and efficient, you will need a skilled designer or contractor.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center call-to-action\"><strong>Get in touch with our hood specialists to save time in finding out your kitchen’s most suitable choice. <a href=\"tel:+1-303-777-7720\">Call Now</a>.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Frequently Asked Questions about Commercial Kitchen Exhaust hoods:</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1.

Here are some of the most common types of commercial kitchen layouts:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Assembly Line Layout:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This one is like the fast-food or cafeteria setup where everything happens in a straight line. You have your preparation station, cooking station, and plating station, all lined up for a smooth flow of food and work.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Island Layout:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Picture the cooking equipment and workstations placed in the middle of the kitchen with space around them for easy movement and access. It is a flexible setup that lets your kitchen crew work together like a well-oiled machine.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Zone Layout:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Think of this one as dividing your kitchen into different zones based on the type of food preparation or cooking tasks. You might have a zone for baking, another zone for grilling, and other zones for frying, and plating.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This commercial kitchen layout keeps things organized and minimizes cross-traffic between different work areas.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Assembly Layout:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This commercial kitchen layout is all about having a central spot where finished dishes are plated and garnished before the food makes its grand entrance to the diners.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This layout is commonly used in fancy restaurants to ensure that each dish is carefully assembled before serving.&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Gallery Layout:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Imagine two lines of equipment and workstations facing each other with a clear path down the middle.

Open Kitchen Layout:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This type of commercial kitchen layout is somehow for show-offs. It typically features a large cooking Island or counter with customers in the front-row seat to watch the chefs work their magic.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This adds a bit of excitement and transparency to the dining experience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Mixed Layout:</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes kitchens like to mix things up and combine different elements to create a custom setup that works best for them. It is like a kitchen remix that takes the best parts of different layouts and makes it your own.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For example, a mixed layout may include an island for cooking, a zone for baking, and an assembly line for plating.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The key to designing a functional commercial kitchen layout is finding the right balance between efficiency, safety, and customer experience.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>So, whether you are flipping burgers or plating up fancy dishes, make sure your kitchen setup is serving success on all fronts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center call-to-action\"><strong>If you are seeking full consultation, look no further than Hood Builder.Call us on <a href=\"tel:+1-800-750-7055\">800-750-7055</a> And let us help.</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:html -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Most Successful Types of Commercial Kitchen Layout</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The first successful commercial kitchen layout is the assembly line layout. This is all about speed and efficiency. In fact, it is like a well-oiled machine with each station passing the dish down the line for completion.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This linear setup allows for a smooth workflow, minimizing chaos and maximizing productivity. Moreover, with everyone in close quarters, communication among kitchen staff is improved.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The second successful layout is the island layout.

Divide and conquer. This type of layout lets each zone focus on the expertise in each area, leading to higher quality.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The zone layout helps to keep things neat and tidy with clear boundaries between different tasks.

Without a make-up air unit, your kitchen could face several issues that may disrupt daily operations:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Preventing Negative Pressure</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Negative pressure can cause smoke and odors to linger inside the kitchen rather than being properly exhausted. A make-up air unit ensures that this doesn’t happen by maintaining a balance between the air expelled and the air brought in, keeping your kitchen well-ventilated.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Improving Staff Comfort</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Working in a kitchen is demanding, and staff comfort is crucial to maintaining morale and productivity. A make-up air unit helps maintain a steady flow of fresh, tempered air, making it easier for your team to focus on preparing great food without being distracted by discomfort.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reducing Equipment Strain</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When the ventilation system is out of balance, HVAC units can be overworked, leading to increased wear and tear. Make-up air units help reduce the strain on other ventilation equipment, extending their lifespan and reducing maintenance costs.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Importance of Proper Make-Up Air in Commercial Kitchens</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you fire up your grills, fryers, and ovens, you're not just cooking delicious food—you’re also expelling a lot of hot, greasy air out of the kitchen. This air is pushed out through exhaust fans and range hoods, creating a gap that must be filled with fresh air. Without a properly functioning make-up air unit to replace the expelled air, your kitchen can quickly become an uncomfortable and unsafe environment. Here’s why make-up air is essential for your commercial kitchen:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Enhancing Air Quality</strong><strong></strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Air quality is a critical aspect of a healthy work environment. In a busy kitchen, smoke, steam, and cooking odors can build up quickly, leading to stuffy and unpleasant conditions. Properly balanced make-up air ensures that the air inside the kitchen stays fresh, removing stale and contaminated air. This helps to protect your staff from breathing in unhealthy air, reducing the risk of respiratory issues and creating a more pleasant workspace.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Maintaining a Comfortable Temperature</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The temperature inside a commercial kitchen can become unbearably hot, especially during peak hours when multiple appliances are running simultaneously. A make-up air unit helps maintain a stable temperature by bringing in fresh, conditioned air that complements your HVAC system. This keeps the kitchen environment comfortable, allowing your team to focus on preparing meals rather than battling the heat. A more comfortable kitchen not only improves staff morale but can also enhance productivity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Enhancing Fire Safety</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2745,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/restaurant-fire-safety-1024x585.jpg\" alt=\"Restaurant Fire Safety\" class=\"wp-image-2745\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In a commercial kitchen, safety is always a top priority, and proper ventilation plays a crucial role in preventing hazards. When there isn’t enough make-up air to balance the exhaust, negative pressure can draw grease-laden vapors back into the kitchen, increasing the risk of grease fires. By supplying a steady stream of fresh air, make-up air units help reduce the accumulation of flammable grease particles, minimizing the risk of dangerous flare-ups and promoting a safer working environment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Staying Code-Compliant</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Regulations for commercial kitchens often include strict guidelines for ventilation and air quality. Many health and safety codes require adequate make-up air to ensure the well-being of both employees and customers. To learn more about ventilation requirements, you can refer to the <strong><a href=\"https://www.ashrae.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers) Standards</a></strong>, which provide detailed guidelines for maintaining proper airflow in commercial spaces.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Reducing Energy Costs</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While it might seem counterintuitive, make-up air units can actually contribute to energy savings in the long run. By balancing the pressure between the indoor and outdoor environment, these units help your HVAC system operate more efficiently. When your HVAC system doesn’t have to work overtime to compensate for pressure imbalances, it uses less energy. This results in lower utility bills and a more sustainable kitchen operation, which is a win-win for your bottom line and the environment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>6. Preventing Negative Air Pressure Issues</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Negative air pressure is a common problem in kitchens without sufficient make-up air. It occurs when more air is being exhausted than is being brought in, creating an imbalance. This can cause doors to be hard to open, drafts to form, and even lead to back-drafting, where smoke and fumes re-enter the kitchen instead of being expelled. Proper make-up air prevents these issues, maintaining a balanced environment where air flows as it should and ensuring a smoother kitchen operation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why Should You Care About Make-Up Air Units?</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Investing in a quality make-up air unit isn’t just about meeting regulatory requirements—it's about creating a safer, more efficient, and comfortable kitchen environment. By ensuring proper airflow, you’re not only protecting your staff and equipment but also enhancing the overall dining experience for your customers. A well-maintained make-up air system keeps your kitchen running smoothly, minimizes disruptions, and ensures that the focus remains on what matters most: serving up great food.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center call-to-action\"><strong>Need Reliable Ventilation Solutions for Your Commercial Kitchen?

Save Money in the Long Run</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With regular hood maintenance, you're not just reducing fire risks—you're cutting costs, improving efficiency, and avoiding downtime, which means more money to reinvest into your business.

Their compact kitchens, high heat output, and frequent movement make hood systems especially vulnerable to grease buildup and ventilation issues. By prioritizing regular hood cleaning and maintenance, you’re not just meeting health and safety standards—you’re protecting your business and the people who depend on it.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Top Hood Cleaning Tips to Keep Your Food Truck Safe and Efficient</strong></h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":2767,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Food-Truck-Hood-Cleaning-1024x585.jpg\" alt=\"Food Truck Hood Cleaning\" class=\"wp-image-2767\"/></figure>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Maintaining your food truck’s hood system is essential for safety, air quality, and operational efficiency. Whether you're new to the food truck business or a seasoned pro, adopting these best practices will help you ensure your hood system stays clean, compliant, and fully functional.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>1. Clean Hood Filters Weekly</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your hood filters play a vital role in trapping grease and airborne particles from cooking. Over time, this buildup can clog filters, reduce airflow, and create a serious fire hazard. Make it a habit to clean your hood filters at least once a week. Use warm soapy water or a degreaser specifically designed for kitchen equipment to remove grease effectively. Staying consistent with weekly cleaning not only keeps your hood system running smoothly but also extends the life of your filters.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To aid in <strong>food truck fire prevention</strong>, make it a habit to clean your hood filters weekly.Use warm soapy water or a degreaser designed for <strong>HVAC cleaning for food trucks</strong> to remove grease effectively.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>2. Wipe Down the Hood Surface Daily</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Daily cleaning may seem tedious, but it’s a critical step in preventing grease and grime from accumulating on your hood’s exterior. Use a non-abrasive cleaning cloth and a grease-cutting solution to wipe down all visible surfaces of your hood. This routine ensures that your hood looks professional and prevents the buildup of grease that could lead to more extensive (and expensive) cleaning efforts.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A cleaner hood system supports <strong>mobile kitchen maintenance</strong>, ensuring your food truck operates at its best</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>3. Schedule Professional Deep Cleaning</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While daily and weekly cleaning tackles surface grease and filters, the internal components of your hood system require professional attention. Over time, grease and debris can accumulate in hard-to-reach areas, including the ductwork and exhaust fans. Hiring a professional hood cleaning service every 3 to 6 months ensures that your system is thoroughly inspected and cleaned, keeping it in compliance with health and safety regulations. Scheduling professional <strong>hood cleaning services</strong> every 3 to 6 months ensures these hidden areas are thoroughly cleaned.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>4. Inspect Your Exhaust System Regularly</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your exhaust system is the backbone of your food truck’s ventilation. Regular inspections can help identify potential issues like clogged ducts, malfunctioning fans, or unusual odors. If you notice decreased airflow or hear unusual noises, address the issue immediately to prevent costly repairs or operational downtime. Partner with a trusted professional, like Hood Builder, to conduct regular inspections and ensure everything runs smoothly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A well-maintained exhaust system supports proper ventilation and aligns with best practices for <strong>HVAC cleaning for food trucks</strong>.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>5. Use Non-Abrasive Cleaning Tools and Solutions</strong></h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cleaning tools and solutions matter. Abrasive scrubbers and harsh chemicals may seem effective at first, but they can scratch and damage the surface of your hood, leading to long-term wear and tear. Invest in non-abrasive sponges, microfiber cloths, and grease-cutting cleaning agents specifically designed for commercial kitchen equipment. This will preserve the integrity of your hood system while maintaining cleanliness.

With a proactive approach, you can extend the lifespan of your unit and ensure that it operates at peak performance. Below are some practical tips to help you stay ahead of common issues:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Schedule Routine Inspections</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Frequent inspections by a professional technician are critical for identifying minor issues before they become major problems. A thorough inspection should include checking the fan, filters, dampers, and overall system for signs of wear or damage. Scheduling these checkups every 3-6 months ensures your unit remains in optimal condition.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Clean or Replace Filters Regularly</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Filters are the frontline defense for your make-up air unit, keeping dust, grease, and other contaminants from clogging the system. Depending on the volume of your kitchen operations, clean or replace filters every 1-3 months. Neglecting this simple task can lead to reduced airflow, poor air quality, and increased energy consumption.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Monitor Ductwork for Blockages or Damage</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The ductwork is a vital component of your make-up air unit, responsible for transporting fresh air into your kitchen. Over time, grease, debris, or physical damage can obstruct airflow. Periodically inspect the ducts for any blockages or signs of wear, and schedule professional cleanings at least once a year to ensure smooth operation.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Check and Calibrate Controls and Sensors</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Modern make-up air units often come with advanced controls and sensors to monitor temperature, airflow, and humidity. Keeping these systems calibrated ensures precise operation and prevents unnecessary energy waste. Check these controls during each maintenance session to confirm they’re functioning correctly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Inspect Dampers and Fans</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dampers and fans play a crucial role in maintaining airflow balance and efficiency. Inspect the dampers to ensure they’re opening and closing correctly and aren’t stuck in one position. For fans, look for unusual noises or vibrations, as these can indicate wear or damage that needs attention.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">6. Verify Heater Functionality</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The heater in your make-up air unit ensures that your kitchen remains warm and comfortable during colder months. Test the heater regularly, especially before the winter season, to confirm it’s operating effectively. Address any power supply issues, thermostat malfunctions, or uneven heating promptly to avoid disruptions.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">7. Keep the Drainage System Clear</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If your unit handles humidity or condensation, a well-functioning drainage system is essential. Inspect the drainage lines for clogs or leaks to prevent water buildup, which can lead to mold growth or structural damage. Clean the drainage system regularly to maintain a healthy and safe environment.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">8. Document Maintenance Activities</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Maintaining a detailed log of all inspections, repairs, and replacements can help you track the condition of your make-up air unit over time. This record is invaluable for scheduling future maintenance, identifying recurring issues, and ensuring compliance with safety regulations.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Benefits of Regular Maintenance</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Consistent upkeep of your make-up air unit offers several advantages:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Enhanced Performance:</strong> Ensures your unit operates efficiently, delivering consistent airflow and temperature regulation.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Energy Savings:</strong> Proper maintenance reduces energy consumption, lowering utility bills.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Improved Air Quality:</strong> Clean filters and ducts prevent contaminants from entering your kitchen, creating a safer workspace.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Extended Lifespan:</strong> Regular care reduces wear and tear, prolonging the life of your unit.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Fewer Repairs:</strong> Addressing minor issues early prevents costly breakdowns and emergency repairs.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Trust Hood Builder for Expert Maintenance Services</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While proactive maintenance is manageable for some, complex issues and system optimizations are best handled by professionals.

Ignoring signs of trouble can lead to reduced air quality, higher energy bills, and even costly equipment failure. Proactive troubleshooting not only minimizes disruptions to your operations but also helps extend the lifespan of your system. Here’s why addressing make-up air unit issues promptly is so critical:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Maintain a Comfortable Kitchen Environment</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Commercial kitchens generate a significant amount of heat, steam, and grease during daily operations. A malfunctioning make-up air unit can result in poor airflow, leading to an uncomfortably hot or stuffy kitchen. Troubleshooting airflow issues ensures that fresh air is consistently brought in, creating a pleasant and productive workspace for your staff.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. Improve Air Quality and Safety</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Poor air quality can negatively impact the health of your kitchen staff and compromise food safety. Without proper ventilation, contaminants like grease particles, smoke, and odors can linger, creating an unhealthy environment. Addressing issues like clogged filters, blocked ducts, or malfunctioning dampers ensures clean, filtered air circulates, keeping your kitchen safe and compliant with health standards.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Boost Energy Efficiency and Reduce Costs</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A make-up air unit that’s struggling to perform due to dirty filters, broken components, or improper settings can consume more energy than necessary. Regular troubleshooting and maintenance keep the system running efficiently, helping to lower energy costs. For example, cleaning filters and ensuring proper damper function can prevent the unit from overworking, which translates to significant savings over time.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Prevent Downtime and Emergency Repairs</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Equipment failure can lead to unexpected downtime, disrupting your kitchen’s operations and causing potential revenue loss. By proactively addressing minor issues—such as unusual noises, uneven temperatures, or frequent cycling—you can prevent them from escalating into major problems. This approach reduces the likelihood of costly emergency repairs and keeps your kitchen running smoothly.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">5. Extend the Lifespan of Your Make-Up Air Unit</h3>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like any piece of equipment, your make-up air unit has a finite lifespan. However, neglecting routine troubleshooting and maintenance can shorten it significantly. Regularly inspecting and addressing issues—such as loose parts, damaged fan blades, or leaking drainage systems—helps reduce wear and tear, ensuring that your unit lasts for years to come.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>How to Troubleshoot Common Make-Up Air Unit Issues</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>While some issues require professional assistance, many common problems can be resolved with basic troubleshooting:</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Inspect Filters and Ducts:</strong> Regularly clean or replace filters and check for blockages in the ductwork.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Monitor Airflow and Temperature:</strong> Pay attention to airflow consistency and temperature imbalances, adjusting dampers or heater settings as needed.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Listen for Unusual Sounds:</strong> Rattling, buzzing, or grinding noises often indicate loose parts or fan issues that need attention.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><strong>Check Control Settings:</strong> Verify that thermostats and sensors are correctly calibrated for optimal performance.</li>\n<!-- /wp:list-item --></ul>\n<!-- /wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Why Partner with Hood Builder for Maintenance and Troubleshooting?</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If troubleshooting seems overwhelming or your make-up air unit requires specialized care, Hood Builder is here to help.

    "post_content": "Here in Denver, we’re still shoveling snow and cranking the heat, but if you’re a restaurant owner planning a kitchen upgrade or a new build, summer’s heat is creeping up fast. Getting a jumpstart on designing your cooling system now can save you a ton of cash and keep your kitchen humming when the mercury rises. Picture this: a sweltering July day, your staff drenched in sweat, your fryers overheating, and your food wilting—nobody wants that nightmare, right? Planning ahead is the key to avoiding it.\n\nPicking out a shiny new HVAC unit or a fancy air conditioner isn’t the whole game. If the system isn’t built for the brutal demands of a commercial kitchen, even the best gear can flop, leaving you with a steamy workspace, cranky cooks, and a ballooning energy bill. In this guide, I’ll walk you through how to design a cooling system that keeps your restaurant kitchen efficient, comfortable, and budget-friendly all summer long. Whether you’re in Denver’s wild weather or somewhere else, these tips will keep the heat at bay.\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center call-to-action\"><strong>Ready to cool your kitchen for summer? Call Hood Builder at <a href=\"tel:+1-800-750-7055\">800-750-7055</a> for a free HVAC quote tailored to your restaurant!</strong></p>\n\n<h2>Energy-Efficient Cooling System Designs for Commercial Kitchens</h2>\nWith energy prices climbing and sustainability becoming a hot topic in the restaurant world, a cooling system that’s kind to your wallet and the planet is a total win. Denver’s weather—freezing one day, sizzling the next—makes smart design non-negotiable for kitchen pros. Let’s break down how to craft a cooling setup that works as hard as your line cooks:\n<h3>Tap Into Passive Cooling Tricks</h3>\nPassive cooling is your secret weapon for keeping the kitchen chill without running the AC into the ground. It’s all about smart, natural hacks that lighten the load on your system. Here’s what you can do in a restaurant kitchen:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Insulate Like a Pro:</strong> Seal up walls, doors, and exhaust zones to lock in cool air and block out heat—vital when ovens and grills are roaring. Think double-layered insulation around hot spots like the fryer station.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Reflective Roofing:</strong> A light-colored or reflective roof above your kitchen bounces heat away before it seeps in. It’s a game-changer if your restaurant’s on the top floor or a single-story building.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Shade It Up:</strong> Slap awnings or sunshades over delivery doors, windows, or any exterior openings near prep areas. It’s a cheap fix that stops the sun from turning your kitchen into an oven.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Ventilation Boosters:</strong> Crank up exhaust fans or add solar chimneys to yank hot air out fast—especially above cooking lines where heat piles up. Pair this with makeup air units to keep fresh, cool air flowing in.</li>\n</ul>\nThese tricks cut how much your HVAC has to hustle, slashing energy bills and sparing your equipment from burnout. For instance, a well-placed exhaust fan can drop the temp near your stove by 10°F, giving your AC a breather. Want more ideas? Check out <a href=\"#\">passive cooling tips</a>.\n<h3>Let the Pros Handle Installation</h3>\nYou could snag the slickest cooling system on the market, but if it’s not installed with your kitchen’s chaos in mind, it’s just a pricey paperweight. Bring in a Denver HVAC crew that knows commercial kitchens—like Hood Builder—to size it right, seal ducts tight, and fit it to your layout. A botched install can mean hot pockets near the grill, grease-clogged vents, or a unit that can’t keep up during a dinner rush. Pros follow standards like those from ASHRAE to avoid leaks or energy waste.\n\nWhy’s this a big deal? Kitchens churn out heat and humidity like nobody’s business—think 100°F-plus near the range on a busy night. A system that’s too small chokes, while one too big short-cycles and leaves steam hanging around. A pro will map your kitchen’s heat zones—grill here, fridge there—and build a setup that hits every corner just right.\n<h3>Embrace the Latest Tech</h3>\nToday’s HVAC tech is miles ahead of the old rattling units, and for a restaurant kitchen, that’s gold. Here’s what to eyeball:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Smart Thermostats:</strong> These wizards adjust temps based on your kitchen’s rhythm—full blast during service, dialed back when you’re closed. They can save you hundreds on energy over a season.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Inverter ACs:</strong> They tweak their speed to match your cooling load—no more guzzling power with constant on-off switches. Perfect for handling a sudden rush.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Energy Star Gear:</strong> Look for that blue label—it signals top efficiency and durability, built to take a kitchen’s punishment.</li>\n \t<li><strong>High-Velocity Fans:</strong> Add these to push cool air where it’s needed most, like over the prep line.</li>\n</ul>\nTake a busy Denver burger joint, for example—they swapped an old unit for an inverter AC last year and cut their summer electric bill by 25%. Curious? Our <a href=\"#\">HVAC selection guide</a> spills all the details.\n<h2>How to Pick the Perfect HVAC System for Your Restaurant Kitchen</h2>\nChoosing the right cooling system isn’t a grab-and-go deal—it’s about your kitchen’s size, location, and the heat your equipment pumps out. In Denver, where we swing from snowy chills to scorching heat, a wrong pick can tank your operation—sweaty staff, spoiled food, and a fried budget. Here’s a table to match your climate to the right setup:\n\n[wpdatatable id=4 table_view=regular]\n\nFor Denver kitchens, a dual-fuel system or mini-split AC often rules—they handle our rollercoaster weather and the intense heat from griddles and ovens. Mini-splits are great for zoning—cool the cook line without freezing the walk-in. Got a big space with heavy gear? A dual-fuel setup balances summer cooling with winter warmth for prep areas. Not sure what your kitchen needs? Call us at <a href=\"tel:+1-800-750-7055\"><span>800-750-7055</span></a>—we’ll figure it out free!\n<h3>A Real Denver Kitchen Win</h3>\nTake Sammy’s Bistro in Denver’s LoDo district. Last summer, they teamed up with Hood Builder for a mini-split AC system tied to their hood setup. When July hit 95°F outside, their kitchen held steady at 70°F—cooks stayed cool, fryers didn’t overheat, and their energy bill dropped 15% from the year before. In winter, the heat pump kept the prep crew cozy during early-morning shifts. It’s real-world proof a smart system pays off—<a href=\"#\">meet our team</a>.\n<h3>Size Matters—Here’s Why</h3>\nSizing’s a huge deal in kitchens. Too big, and your system cools fast but shuts off, leaving humidity from boiling pots or dishwashers to linger—think sticky floors and grumpy staff. Too small, and it runs nonstop, barely denting the heat from your ovens. A pro calculates your kitchen’s “load”—factoring in square footage, hood exhaust rates, and heat from every burner and broiler. One Denver café learned this the hard way: their undersized AC couldn’t handle brunch rushes, and they lost hours fixing it mid-season. Get it right with our <a href=\"#\">sizing guide</a>.\n<h3>Kitchen-Specific Challenges</h3>\nRestaurants aren’t like homes—your cooling system’s battling grease, steam, and constant door traffic. A good design accounts for:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Grease Buildup:</strong> Filters and coils need extra love to stay clear.</li>\n \t<li><strong>High Heat Zones:</strong> Target cooling where it’s hottest, like the grill line.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Staff Comfort:</strong> Keep temps steady so your crew doesn’t burn out.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Maintenance Tips to Keep Your Kitchen Cooling System Running Strong</h2>\n<img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Kitchen-Cooling-System.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2873 size-full\" />\n\nA little upkeep keeps your HVAC system purring through Denver’s brutal summers—and saves you from mid-rush breakdowns. Here’s your kitchen-ready checklist:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Book Regular Checkups:</strong> Schedule a pro tune-up with Hood Builder before summer hits—twice yearly is smart for kitchens.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Clean Filters Often:</strong> Swap or wash filters monthly—grease and dust clog them fast near fryers.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Clear Outdoor Units:</strong> Sweep debris off condensers, especially if they’re near greasy exhausts or alley trash.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Unblock Vents:</strong> Keep gear, crates, or shelves away from air vents—cool air needs to flow free.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Monitor Refrigerant:</strong> Low levels mean leaks—fix them fast to avoid a hot kitchen during service.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Use Smart Thermostats:</strong> Save energy by cutting cooling when the kitchen’s quiet—think late nights or prep-only shifts.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Seal Ducts:</strong> Stop leaks above drop ceilings—lost air means lost money in a busy kitchen.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Shade Windows:</strong> Add blinds or film near prep or dish areas to block afternoon sun.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Listen Up:</strong> Strange noises or greasy smells? Call a pro before it’s a crisis mid-dinner rush.</li>\n</ul>\nDon’t Do These:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Ignore odd smells—</strong>could be grease frying your system.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Crank the thermostat too low—</strong>it won’t cool faster, just wear out your unit.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Skip maintenance—</strong>downtime during peak hours kills profits.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Let vents clog—</strong>blocked air turns your kitchen into a sauna.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center call-to-action\">Heat slowing your line down? Call Hood Builder at <a href=\"tel:+1-800-750-7055\"><span>800-750-7055</span></a> for fast fixes!</p>\n\n<h3>Bonus Tip: Watch Your Energy Bill</h3>\nIf your bill’s creeping up despite steady use, something’s off—grease on coils, a failing fan, or an old unit gasping its last. One Denver diner saw their bill jump 30% last summer; turns out, a clogged filter was choking their AC. Catch it early, and you’ll dodge a meltdown when you’re slammed.\n<h3>Grease and Grit: The Kitchen Difference</h3>\nCommercial kitchens throw curveballs—grease sticks to everything, and steam’s a constant foe. Clean coils quarterly, not just yearly, and check exhaust fans weekly. A little extra elbow grease here keeps your system alive longer.\n<h2>FAQs About Designing Your Kitchen Cooling System</h2>\nGot questions?
