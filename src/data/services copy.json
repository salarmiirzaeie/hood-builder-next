The law isn’t set out to inconvenience you. Vent hood cleaning to remove kitchen grease prevents fire and improves air flow, leading to a safer and cleaner kitchen environment. As an added bonus, you can improve the life of your vent hoods and exhaust systems by engaging in regular cleaning and maintenance.[\/vc_column_text][\/ultimate_exp_section][ultimate_exp_section title=\"How often should I have my vent hoods cleaned?\" cnt_bg_color=\"#ffffff\" icon=\"Defaults-plus-square-o\" new_icon=\"Defaults-minus-square-o\" icon_size=\"20\" icon_color=\"#a9a790\" icon_hover_color=\"#a9a790\" icon_active_color=\"#a9a790\" extra_class=\"wps-faq\" font_family=\"font_family:Montserrat|font_call:Montserrat|variant:500\" heading_style=\"font-weight:500;\" title_font_size=\"desktop:18px;\" icon_margin=\"margin-right:10px;\" title_padding=\"padding-bottom:0px;\"][vc_column_text]At Hood Builder, we recommend that incredibly busy kitchens engage in quarterly cleaning schedules, such as those operating 24-hours per day. For moderately busy kitchens, a thorough cleaning every six months should suffice. Low-volume kitchens can get away with annual vent hood cleanings, but for kitchens that primarily use wood or coal, monthly cleanings might be best.[\/vc_column_text][\/ultimate_exp_section][ultimate_exp_section title=\"Why can’t I just rely on my employees to clean my vent hoods?\" cnt_bg_color=\"#ffffff\" icon=\"Defaults-plus-square-o\" new_icon=\"Defaults-minus-square-o\" icon_size=\"20\" icon_color=\"#a9a790\" icon_hover_color=\"#a9a790\" icon_active_color=\"#a9a790\" extra_class=\"wps-faq\" font_family=\"font_family:Montserrat|font_call:Montserrat|variant:500\" heading_style=\"font-weight:500;\" title_font_size=\"desktop:18px;\" icon_margin=\"margin-right:10px;\" title_padding=\"padding-bottom:0px;\" desc_padding=\"padding-top:0px;\" desc_margin=\"margin-top:0px;\"][vc_column_text]Cleaning vent hoods and the ventilation systems they’re attached to is a tedious task that requires experience, training and specialized equipment. If you employ individuals who happen to be qualified and certified, that is an ideal scenario for passing vent hood inspections and getting the most efficiency and safety from your vent hood performance.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if you don’t employ anyone who is qualified and certified to clean kitchen ventilation systems, it pays to hire a professional team like Hood Builder to do the work for you.[\/vc_column_text][\/ultimate_exp_section][ultimate_exp_section title=\"When I hire Hood Builder to clean my kitchen, will I have to shut my business down?\" cnt_bg_color=\"#ffffff\" icon=\"Defaults-plus-square-o\" new_icon=\"Defaults-minus-square-o\" icon_size=\"20\" icon_color=\"#a9a790\" icon_hover_color=\"#a9a790\" icon_active_color=\"#a9a790\" extra_class=\"wps-faq\" font_family=\"font_family:Montserrat|font_call:Montserrat|variant:500\" heading_style=\"font-weight:500;\" title_font_size=\"desktop:18px;\" title_padding=\"padding-bottom:0px;\" icon_margin=\"margin-right:10px;\"][vc_column_text]At Hood Builder, we work around your schedule.

Imagine a situation where the restaurant equipment sustains a failure at an unfortunate time. This will not just reflect badly on your business, but it will also drive potential visitors away. As a smart restaurant owner, you should always seek the help of a professional company to correctly install every single component of the entire set of equipment as well as provide regular maintenance for the same. Any kind of negligence in this regard will only lead to wastage, added costs, and losses in the long term. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Hood Builder, we only deal in the highest quality restaurant equipment. After all, good equipment lasts longer, consumes less energy, and will run just as you expect it to. You should expect nothing less for your restaurant or hospitality business. This is the only way to guarantee business success.<\/span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1-303-777-7720\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (303-777-7720)<\/a><\/p>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To ensure we offer only the most exceptional equipment to our customers, we only work with suppliers with extensive knowledge of the restaurant industry. Not only do we then offer the equipment you need, but we also offer full professional installation and all the maintenance that may be required to keep your business running at peak efficiency at all times. By using formalized processes and the right technology, you can avoid costly repairs and save a lot of money.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter what type of equipment you need for your restaurant or vendor business, Hood Builder is here to help.<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Cooking equipment<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Beverage equipment<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Industrial ovens<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Industrial dish washing machines<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Industrial kitchen work stations and work tables<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Commercial ice machines<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Commercial sinks<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Food display &amp; warming equipment<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Industrial refrigeration<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you decide to work with us, you get only the most trusted brands of restaurant equipment and the reliability to match. Whether we are constructing your restaurant or performing a full remodel, we will go to all the lengths necessary to deliver on every one of our promises. You get only the highest quality equipment from us, fully installed, and that’s a promise.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Restaurant Equipment Installation<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Installation of all the restaurant equipment is a complex procedure, which requires expert knowledge and skills as well as consideration of multiple factors that will support their smooth operation.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take the example of a commercial ice machine. Before you can start to use it, you must first have it installed in an accurate manner while making sure all filtering, plumbing, and electrical factors are taken care of. Whether it is HVAC installation, setting up the refrigeration equipment, or the commercial hood installation, proper settings should be done for each of these. Likewise, the installation of the fire suppression system should be performed in a correct manner so as to ensure the equipment delivers the highest level of performance in the event of a fire. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Hood Builder, we have highly trained professionals to carry out the installation of all the equipment and systems in your commercial restaurant. For each project, we create an equipment installation checklist, which ensures smooth installation and maximum efficiency from the get-go.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you have our expert installation team by your side, you can let go of your stress and have complete peace of mind.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<b>Restaurant Equipment Care and Maintenance<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the beginning, you may want to overlook the maintenance of all the equipment in your commercial restaurant. But, you will ultimately end up spending a lot of money on managing repairs later. Ignoring maintenance will shrink your profits and lead to heavy losses in the long term. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, you should pay serious attention to the regular care and maintenance of all restaurant equipment from day one.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Setting up restaurant equipment is a big investment. If you take care of the minor faults and issues as soon as they arise, significant repairs will not be required later. The cost of significant repairs is actually much higher than what you spend on regular check-ups and maintenance of the equipment. The poor quality of the equipment also takes its toll on the quality of food. If you plan to decrease wastage, maintain food quality, speed up operation and prolong the life of all the equipment, you should include regular care and checkup into your overall business plan.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While we suggest all restaurant owners train their staff in proper equipment etiquette, we also warn them against attempting to fix minor issues and faults with the equipment themselves. In the course of fixing the equipment, you may end up enlarging the issue without your knowledge. Worse still, you may also lose the warranties as a result. So, always hire an expert for help.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Hood Builder, we provide top quality maintenance for all kinds of commercial kitchens and restaurants. Our professionals are well-trained incorrect maintenance procedures and industry best practices. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our restaurant equipment maintenance service includes:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vent, hood, and ductwork cleanup<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grease filter cleaning<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HVAC recharge and replacement<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fire sprinkler system inspection and repair<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deep fat fryer inspection<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Motor seal repair and replacement<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Electrical interlocking repair<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Refrigeration recharge and maintenance<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For effective maintenance, you are advised to create a schedule in advance with the help of our experts.

No matter how good the food is, if the place is not well-ventilated, it will take a toll on your business. Whether it is the kitchen or the dining area, it is your duty to make the areas safe for workers and guests. This is exactly where the role of HVAC ventilation systems comes in.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a large commercial kitchen, the biggest challenge is to get rid of the heat, smoke and contaminated air on a constant basis. Installation of a modern HVAC system will ensure that your kitchen as well as the dining area remains free from hot and contaminated air and provides a comfortable environment for everyone in the building. However, you should only rely on highly experienced and certified technicians when it comes to HVAC ventilation system installation and repair. Based on the specific location, size and the type of cooking done in your kitchen, you will need to invest in the most suitable and high quality HVAC system.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Full-Service Ventilation Services<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Hood Builder, our expert technicians are certified to fabricate, sell, install, and service high-quality ventilation systems for all types of restaurants in Denver, Colorado.

Over the years, we have built durable upblast fans, utility fans, and ventilators that get the job done every time. It is due to our extensive experience that we quickly understand the specific needs of a client and then design or customize an HVAC ventilation system that keeps the entire facility safe and comfortable.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our roof sidewall discharge and upblast fans offer high durability and performance and have been tested for all grease-prone applications.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our sidewall and upblast discharge fans can be configured with a variety of accessories to address the myriad challenges faced in the commercial kitchen.

Most of all, these systems will enhance the safety of people and keep illnesses at bay.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Ventilation System Repair and Cleaning<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every HVAC ventilation system requires cleaning and maintenance. Over time, an HVAC system can get clogged and cause different types of issues. If you plan your system to run at the maximum level of efficiency without any issues, you should give it proper and timely maintenance.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Hood Builder, we do not only install a wide range of HVAC systems, but also provide their repair and cleaning services. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to repairing or cleaning an HVAC ventilation system, DIY techniques are never a good idea. Though your system requires repair, balancing and cleaning, you should also make sure it stays in the best possible shape. That is exactly why you should seek the help of professional HVAC technicians and schedule the cleaning of kitchen exhaust ducts and air ducts with them. In this way, you will keep your system in an excellent shape as well as extend the lifespan of the system, while saving a lot of money in maintenance in the long term.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Air Balancing Service<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The contaminated air inside a commercial kitchen needs to be pulled out. At the same time, fresh air from outside should be pulled in to replace the emptied air. This is one of the key roles of an HVAC ventilation system. In fact, the system should perform air balancing in an accurate manner, so that neither positive nor negative pressure is created inside the restaurant kitchen.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Air balancing refers to an optimization of an HVAC system, so that the kitchen area remains cool and comfortable. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Hood Builder in Denver, CO, we specialize in air balancing of all types and sizes of HVAC ventilation systems. Our technicians are expertly trained in working with all sizes of duct openings in restaurants. The best practice for restaurant owners is to get air balancing done at the interval of every two years, or as per the specific requirements or issues that may arise with a system.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We follow the entire HVAC <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/air-balancing\/\">air balancing<\/a> procedure with a great deal of attention while focusing on each step. Right from conducting all the preliminary checks, measuring air quantities and measuring the flow from one terminal to another to finally balancing the flow rates across all terminals, our technicians will carry out the entire procedure with the highest level of accuracy.

Along with great food, you need to provide a relaxing and comfortable atmosphere as well to keep guests coming. In fact, you will fail to build a solid reputation in the industry, if the ambiance in your facility is not welcoming. When it comes to creating a perfect environment, the efficiency of the heating and air-conditioning plays a vital role. As a smart restaurant owner, you need to invest in an HVAC system, which operates at maximum efficiency and keeps energy costs low.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Hood Builder, we deal in factory-direct <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/restaurant-kitchen-hvac-system\/\">HVAC systems<\/a> as well as specialize in their installation and maintenance. These systems serve both heating and cooling needs in a proper manner.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1-303-777-7720\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote 303-777-7720<\/a><\/p>\r\n[\/vc_column_text][ultimate_spacer height=\"60\" height_on_mob_landscape=\"40\" height_on_mob=\"40\"][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][ultimate_spacer height=\"90\" height_on_mob_landscape=\"70\" height_on_mob=\"70\"][\/vc_column][vc_column offset=\"vc_col-lg-7 vc_col-md-7\"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h2><b>Criteria for Selection of HVAC Units<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it is crucial to invest in energy-efficient HVAC components, it is also important to choose the right type of heating and air-conditioning units for your commercial kitchen, restaurant, dining facility, cafeteria, etc.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A restaurant or dining facility has a heating and cooling requirement for the entire year. Whether it is heating or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/hvac\/air-conditioning\/\">air-conditioning<\/a>, the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/hvac\/\"> HVAC system<\/a> you install should do its job in a highly efficient manner. Since all HVAC components are not the same, you need to install and use a system that is ideal for the kind of commercial facility you operate so that energy costs remain economical.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key criteria for selecting the most appropriate type of HVAC units for your restaurant or commercial kitchen are as follows:<\/span>\r\n<h3><b>Aesthetics:<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The layout of the HVAC components you install should be a good match for the layout of your kitchen. The units should be installed in a way that blends them with the overall décor of the restaurant in an unobtrusive manner. At the same time, the heating and cooling components should maximize space rather than minimize the space inside the facility. That is exactly why the aesthetics of the HVAC components you invest in is of utmost importance.<\/span>\r\n<h3><b>Energy Efficiency:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <\/span><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is crucial to consider the energy efficiency of the HVAC units you outfit your kitchen with. If you have a large kitchen, the units will operate for several hours at a time. If the units consume an excessive amount of energy, the total running costs of the system will shoot up. Always invest in heating components that can operate at very low temperatures.<\/span>\r\n<h3><b>Split System or Packaged:<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There are many types of heating and air-conditioning units available for commercial facilities. If you choose to install the split system type, one or more units can be placed inside the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aps-hoods.com\/the-definitive-guide-to-restaurant-facility-cleaning\/\">facility<\/a> and one outside the facility. The two units can then be linked using pipework. On the other hand, packaged heating and cooling systems come with a single unit that is placed inside the facility. Split system heating units offer a high level of energy efficiency. The installation procedures for different types of units also vary. It is best to consult an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aps-hoods.com\/services\/commercial-hvac\/\">HVAC system<\/a> specialist to determine what is ideal for your restaurant.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on these criteria, you will be able to choose the most ideal heating and cooling units for the type of commercial facility you run. For further details in this connection, you should reach out to one of our HVAC experts at the Hood Builder, which offers services throughout Denver, CO.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>We Provide Leading HVAC Heating Brands and Systems<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Hood Builder, we provide and install a wide variety of heating and cooling systems in commercial kitchens, restaurants, dining centers, and cafeterias among others.

That is exactly why you need to pay utmost attention to the design of the commercial kitchen exhaust hoods and how it coordinates with the HVAC.\r\n\r\nThere is truly much more to the ventilation hoods than you might have thought. Whether you already operate a restaurant or plan to remodel an existing one, adequate attention must be paid to exhaust hoods.\r\n<h2>Hood Builder: The Ideal Destination for Exhaust Hoods Services<\/h2>\r\nAt Hood Builder, we have been providing commercial businesses with ventilation hoods for over 25 years. We are of the firm belief that a well-performing ventilation hood will provide a cleaner working environment for your staff, a warm and cozy space for your patrons, and immense savings on energy costs.\r\n\r\nComprehensive research and development is the foundation of our ventilation hoods services for restaurants. Our insightful knowledge and experience in this industry allow us to carefully match the vent hood systems with the operation of your kitchen. In a large restaurant with a great deal of cooking and food preparation on a daily basis, you also need to stay compliant with the building codes. To deal with a large amount of heat and smoke and reduce fire hazards, you will need to outfit your food facility with an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.aps-hoods.com\/services\/fan-servicing\/\">exhaust hood<\/a> with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationwidefireprotection.com\/services\/restaurant-maintenance\/fire-suppression-systems-fire-extinguisher-sales\/\">fire suppression<\/a>. This will ensure the dangers of fire are minimized and the staff does their jobs in a healthy work environment and your guests remain safe from physical injuries due to fire.\r\n\r\nRemoval of grease is important not just to minimize the risk of fire, but also for ensuring a clean and hygienic atmosphere in the restaurant. Our team of highly trained and skilled technicians has a vast knowledge of how different types of vent hoods work and which one is ideal for your needs.\r\n<h2>Vent Hoods for Cleaner Air<\/h2>\r\nThe purpose of installing the vent hoods is to maintain better air quality inside the kitchen and the dining area. The heat and smoke need proper removal through well-laid-out ducts. Balancing the airflow is not an easy feat. The job requires expert skills and extensive experience in the field.\r\n\r\nFor your hood to function properly, every aspect of the construction and installation phase must work together, from the design and fabrication to the construction to the installation process. When done correctly, your vent hoods will ensure that your kitchen runs efficiently and healthily from open to close.\r\n<h2>Why Hood Builder is Different<\/h2>\r\nFirst, our specialists will inspect your facility to take the key measurements of the space and then develop the proposed design after a detailed discussion with you. Then, we will start working on the ventilation design to smartly engineer a vent hood system, which is the right match for your facility.\r\n<h2>We Install the Right Vent Hoods for Your Needs<\/h2>\r\nWe install all types of hoods including both Type I and Type II, and all of our ventilation systems are installed in a fire-safe area of the kitchen to prevent accidents. When looking for exhaust hoods for your own kitchen, you must have come across these vent hood types. What is important is to understand how one type of vent hood differs from the other and select the hood system which is an exact match for the specific needs of your commercial kitchen or restaurant.\r\n\r\nWhether you should install Type 1 or Type 2 depends on the kind of cooking and food preparation you do in the kitchen. So, first of all, you should check out the appliances you use. Type 1 has been designed to be installed in food facilities where cooking activities produce grease and smoke on a regular basis. So, this type of vent hood also includes a fire protection system. On the other hand, the Type 2 vent hoods are suited to spaces where cooking produces only heat and steam. Apart from this, there are multiple other things that you need to take into account to choose the most suitable exhaust hood for your food facility. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/hoods\/installation\/\">hood design<\/a>, exhaust rate, and the physical size of the vent hoods are important considerations when you are going to fit your kitchen with a ventilation system.\r\n\r\nWith our vent hood experts at your service, you can feel confident that your restaurant will get the most ideal and the highest quality of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/hvac\/ventilation\/\">ventilation system<\/a> for the safety and comfort of your staff and guests.\r\n<h2>The Ventilation Design<\/h2>\r\nThe design of the kitchen exhaust hoods and the ventilation is equally important. The technician will consider the size and shape as well the length of the ducting runs to the outside. Plus, how the ducting will bend for maximum efficiency of the entire ventilation system is a key concern.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the ducting has longer runs and more bends, the kitchen will need a higher exhaust rate per minute. A lower exhaust rate will only mean less exhaust air will be removed. This, in turn, will take its toll on the air quality inside the kitchen as well as the dining area. Experts pay special attention to ‘makeup air’ when developing the design of the vent hood system. As the exhaust hood removes contaminated air from the kitchen, the removed air needs to be replaced with clean and fresh air from outside. That is exactly where makeup air plays a crucial role. To ensure proper air balance, the design has to be perfect.\r\n\r\nHood Builder is a trusted name in the ventilation hoods industry with several years of proven restaurant experience. Our experts will perform the task considering all the key factors to ensure better air quality.\r\n<h2>Get in Touch with Our Vent Hood Specialists<\/h2>\r\nSince the food Service industry regulations require a higher standard of air quality than most buildings, Hood Builder will ensure that you get exactly what you expect – the best ventilation system for proper airflow and disposal.\r\n\r\nFor kitchen ventilation hoods that are regulation-compliant, efficient, and built to last, Hood Builder should be your first and only choice.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1-303-777-7720\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote 303-777-7720<\/a><\/p>\r\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column offset=\"vc_col-lg-offset-1 vc_col-lg-4 vc_col-md-4\"][vc_wp_custommenu nav_menu=\"11\" el_class=\"wps-sidebar-related-links\" title=\"Related Links\"][templatera id=\"192\"][\/vc_column][vc_column][ultimate_spacer height=\"90\" height_on_mob_landscape=\"70\" height_on_mob=\"70\"][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row full_width=\"wps-full-width\"][vc_column][templatera id=\"96\"][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","post_title":"Hoods","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"hoods","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2023-11-19 04:52:15","post_modified_gmt":"2023-11-19 04:52:15","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"12","guid":"http:\/\/hoodbuilder.dev\/?page_id=209","menu_order":"0","post_type":"page","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","image":"http:\/\/hoodbuilder.dev\/?p=256","author":"Massoud Farazandeh"},

Then, we will start working on the ventilation design to smartly engineer a vent hood system, which is the right match for your facility.\r\n<h2>We Install the Right Vent Hoods for Your Needs<\/h2>\r\nWe install all types of hoods including both Type I and Type II, and all of our ventilation systems are installed in a fire-safe area of the kitchen to prevent accidents. When looking for exhaust hoods for your own kitchen, you must have come across these vent hood types. What is important is to understand how one type of vent hood differs from the other and select the hood system which is an exact match for the specific needs of your commercial kitchen or restaurant.\r\n\r\nWhether you should install Type 1 or Type 2 depends on the kind of cooking and food preparation you do in the kitchen. So, first of all, you should check out the appliances you use. Type 1 has been designed to be installed in food facilities where cooking activities produce grease and smoke on a regular basis. So, this type of vent hood also includes a fire protection system. On the other hand, the Type 2 vent hoods are suited to spaces where cooking produces only heat and steam. Apart from this, there are multiple other things that you need to take into account to choose the most suitable exhaust hood for your food facility. For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/hoods\/installation\/\">hood design<\/a>, exhaust rate, and the physical size of the vent hoods are important considerations when you are going to fit your kitchen with a ventilation system.\r\n\r\nWith our vent hood experts at your service, you can feel confident that your restaurant will get the most ideal and the highest quality of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/hvac\/ventilation\/\">ventilation system<\/a> for the safety and comfort of your staff and guests.\r\n<h2>The Ventilation Design<\/h2>\r\nThe design of the kitchen exhaust hoods and the ventilation is equally important. The technician will consider the size and shape as well the length of the ducting runs to the outside. Plus, how the ducting will bend for maximum efficiency of the entire ventilation system is a key concern.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the ducting has longer runs and more bends, the kitchen will need a higher exhaust rate per minute. A lower exhaust rate will only mean less exhaust air will be removed. This, in turn, will take its toll on the air quality inside the kitchen as well as the dining area. Experts pay special attention to ‘makeup air’ when developing the design of the vent hood system. As the exhaust hood removes contaminated air from the kitchen, the removed air needs to be replaced with clean and fresh air from outside. That is exactly where makeup air plays a crucial role. To ensure proper air balance, the design has to be perfect.\r\n\r\nHood Builder is a trusted name in the ventilation hoods industry with several years of proven restaurant experience. Our experts will perform the task considering all the key factors to ensure better air quality.\r\n<h2>Get in Touch with Our Vent Hood Specialists<\/h2>\r\nSince the food Service industry regulations require a higher standard of air quality than most buildings, Hood Builder will ensure that you get exactly what you expect – the best ventilation system for proper airflow and disposal.\r\n\r\nFor kitchen ventilation hoods that are regulation-compliant, efficient, and built to last, Hood Builder should be your first and only choice.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1-303-777-7720\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote 303-777-7720<\/a><\/p>\r\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column offset=\"vc_col-lg-offset-1 vc_col-lg-4 vc_col-md-4\"][vc_wp_custommenu nav_menu=\"11\" el_class=\"wps-sidebar-related-links\" title=\"Related Links\"][templatera id=\"192\"][\/vc_column][vc_column][ultimate_spacer height=\"90\" height_on_mob_landscape=\"70\" height_on_mob=\"70\"][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row full_width=\"wps-full-width\"][vc_column][templatera id=\"96\"][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","post_title":"Hoods","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"hoods","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2023-11-19 04:52:15","post_modified_gmt":"2023-11-19 04:52:15","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"12","guid":"http:\/\/hoodbuilder.dev\/?page_id=209","menu_order":"0","post_type":"page","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","image":"http:\/\/hoodbuilder.dev\/?p=259","author":"Massoud Farazandeh"},

If you run a large or commercial kitchen, keeping it well-ventilated becomes even more important for the health and safety of employees and guests. That is exactly why restaurants install an exhaust hood system, commonly called range hood. If you have outfitted your facility with this system, you need to abide by the “make up air” codes, among many other codes that the NFPA has outlined in great detail. Cooking and food preparation fills a large kitchen with plenty of smoky and hot air. While this air needs fast removal, the HVAC system also needs to replace it with fresh air from outside. That is exactly where the role of makeup air gains importance for commercial facility owners.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the Hood Builder in Denver, CO, we specialize in exhaust hood makeup air services for a wide range of commercial kitchens, restaurants, dining facilities, cafeterias and food preparation facilities.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1-303-777-7720\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote 303-777-7720<\/a><\/p>\r\n[\/vc_column_text][ultimate_spacer height=\"60\" height_on_mob_landscape=\"40\" height_on_mob=\"40\"][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][ultimate_spacer height=\"90\" height_on_mob_landscape=\"70\" height_on_mob=\"70\"][\/vc_column][vc_column offset=\"vc_col-lg-7 vc_col-md-7\"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h2><b>Problems Due to Low Air Replacement<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a restaurant owner or manager, it is your utmost duty to keep the entire building safe against health and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationwidefireprotection.com\/\">fire<\/a> hazards. That is exactly why the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nfpa.org\/\">NFPA<\/a> requires you to adhere to the building codes. By staying code-compliant, you will provide a healthy and safe environment for the occupants of the commercial building or the facility. As per some building codes, you will need to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/hoods\/installation\/\">install<\/a> a makeup air unit, particularly if your exhaust hood has a capacity of over 600 CFM.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you plan for adequate <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/hvac\/ventilation\/\">ventilation<\/a> in the building, hood makeup air is essential for you. This helps with the replacement of the air that is removed in your commercial kitchen through an exhaust hood system.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When your facility has low air replacement, it builds negative pressure that creates an unsafe working environment. Not just that, this pressure can also create many issues with the range hood. For example, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/hoods\/fans\/\">hood fan<\/a> can malfunction as a result of the negative pressure created in the building. In large and busy kitchens, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/hvac\/\">HVAC system<\/a> cannot handle air replacement in a proper manner. Hood <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/hoods\/make-up-air\/\">makeup air<\/a> is an ideal solution to this problem. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/hvac\/make-up-air\/\">makeup air<\/a> unit functions to bring in additional air in order to replace the lost air in the kitchen.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In simple terms, the makeup air unit creates equality between the amount of air lost and the amount of air brought in. At the Hood Builder, we have been serving a large number of restaurants and commercial kitchens with code-compliant and NFPA-approved makeup air units all across Denver. Our makeup <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/hoods\/\">hoods<\/a> also carry the approval of NSF, ETL, and UL among others.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>How to Know If You Need Makeup Air<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on the scenarios you have in your commercial kitchen, you will be able to know whether a makeup air unit is required.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will need makeup air if:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The exhaust hood has a pulling capacity of 1200+ CFM<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your kitchen has poor ventilation<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The building codes necessitate the use of the device<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your exhaust hood operates for several hours<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A common misconception among many facility owners is that powerful HVAC systems eliminate the need for makeup air. In fact, the more powerful an exhaust hood you have, the greater the need for using a makeup air unit. It is not actually about how powerful your range hood is, what really matters is whether the space in your restaurant or kitchen is adequately ventilated.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your kitchen does not have plenty of moving air, a makeup air unit is ideal for improving ventilation in a drastic manner. Once installed, the unit will pull in an ample amount of clean and fresh air as the exhaust hood removes the hot,  grease-contaminated air from the kitchen. The vent hood gathers the cooking exhaust and propels it through the ducting outside your facility. If your exhaust hood runs for several hours at a time, thE contaminated air will be continuously removed from the kitchen. This, in turn, creates a need to have more fresh air from outside in order to fill in the amount of lost air. You may need to use a makeup air unit even as per what the building code in your area requires.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For detailed information in this regard, don’t hesitate to reach out to one of our exhaust hood specialists at the Hood Builder.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>What the Makeup Air Unit Includes<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also referred to as a makeup air hood, the unit or kit has a range hood damper and air pressure sensor as its key components. Each of these is there to perform a specific function. Our HVAC technicians have a sound knowledge of all kinds of makeup air units and how they work. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The makeup air unit is attached to the ductwork of the range hood. It has a pressure switch that tells the exhaust hood damper when to get active and pull in fresh and clean air into the facility. The role of the air pressure sensor is to control and maintain proper airflow into the kitchen. Once the device has been correctly installed, you will have quality air balance and flow. Proper ventilation will improve the quality of indoor air and create a healthy and safe environment.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Get in Touch for High Quality Makeup Air Unit<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Made of stainless steel, our makeup air hoods are highly proficient in the removal of smoke, odor, and grease and fill the lost air with clean and fresh air from outside the commercial facility.

For this reason, your industrial or commercial kitchen must have the right ventilation system installed to keep the air clean and healthy for your staff and customers. Not having the right ventilation can also lead to a number of fire and safety issues as well as bad marks from the health department.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key benefits of investing in a range hood include:<\/span>\r\n<h3><b>Reduce Heat Buildup:<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When running a commercial kitchen, one of the biggest issues all facility managers need to deal with is the amount of heat produced due to hours of cooking and food preparation. A commercial range hood system makes it easy to pull all the heat out of the facility in an effective manner. This, in turn, makes the kitchen environment comfortable for employees.<\/span>\r\n<h3><b>Maintain Indoor Air Quality:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <\/span><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smoke and other food fumes contaminate the kitchen air, which causes discomfort to the staff. Low air quality also takes a toll on the other areas of the restaurants. Installing a range hood and ventilation system replaces contaminated air with fresh air from outside.<\/span>\r\n<h3><b>Improve Kitchen Lighting:<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The commercial hood has space where you can easily install LED lights.

The grease has to be cleaned periodically to enable your system to work efficiently. If this is not done, you may have a fire hazard on your hands, which you most certainly do not want. If you operate a commercial kitchen or a restaurant, you should remain aware of the massive risk of fire due to the hidden deposits of grease in the exhaust hood or the range hood and get rid of it in a timely manner.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The National <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nationwidefireprotection.com\/\">Fire Protection<\/a> Association reports that more than 11,000 fires happen in commercial kitchens every year. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The amount of property damage amounts to more than $150 million, and one of the leading causes of those fires is grease catching fire that accumulates in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/hoods\/installation\/\">kitchen exhaust hood<\/a> and exhaust systems. This means that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/hoods\/cleaning\/\">commercial hood cleaning<\/a> is an essential requirement.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hoodbuilder is a professional hood cleaning service in Denver, Colorado. We have been the staple cleaner for many well-known commercial kitchens, and we want to be the same for your facility too.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Hood Cleaning Service &amp; Inspections – Commercial Grease Cleaner<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In our cleaning process, we adhere to the cleaning guidelines outlined by the National Fire Protection Association. We use hot water pressure washing and polish after we are done to keep your hoods looking pristine. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the job has been done, we’ll leave our certification sticker on your hood for easy identification by inspectors in Denver, Co.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cleaning of the kitchen hood and vents is a messy task, which should always be performed by qualified professionals. First of all, our team of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/general-contracting\/grease-trap\/\">grease cleaners<\/a> will clear out the area around the exhaust hood. This includes disconnecting the electrical power to cooking equipment and gas lines. Once the area has been cleared and the electrical connections in that area have been turned off, the cleaning procedure begins. Whether it is the hood canopy, the ductwork, or the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/hoods\/fans\/\">exhaust fans<\/a>, our professionals properly clean every area, inside and outside, and collect all the grease deposits using the latest tools and techniques.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the exhaust hood system has been power-washed and cleaned, the kitchen surface will have water and residue all over. So, our professionals will continue the cleaning procedure to eliminate all the oil and fat residue and debris from every area to have a fully functional and clean kitchen.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Why You Should Keep the Restaurant Kitchen Hood Clean<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a commercial kitchen, the range hood consistently gathers a lot of dirt, grease, and grime as well as contaminated air flowing through the system. Getting rid of all of this offers a number of benefits.<\/span>\r\n<h3><b>Improved Airflow:<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Grease and grime deposits contaminated the air inside the kitchen. Over time, the airflow in the kitchen deteriorates in quality. As a result of this, it becomes quite difficult for the staff to work comfortably. Such an unhealthy environment also takes a toll on the other areas of the commercial kitchen. Professional hood cleaning helps you avoid all these issues.<\/span>\r\n<h3><b>Reduce the Risk of Fire:<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> At all times, you need to keep your kitchen well-protected from fire hazards. The consistent buildup of grease increases the risk of a kitchen fire. If the cleaning of the range hoods is ignored or delayed, it can lead to serious consequences for the staff as well as guests. The accountability for the accident will always remain with you, the restaurant owner. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Therefore, it is crucial to hire <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/outsource-your-commercial-kitchen-cleaning-to-hood-builder\/\">commercial hood cleaning services<\/a> as per a frequency that is ideal for your commercial kitchen.<\/span>\r\n<h3><b>Grease-related Falls:<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Oil, fats, and grease also make the kitchen surface slippery. This increases the risk of slips and falls for the workers in the kitchen as well as anyone who enters this space. Proper hood cleaning will help you keep the kitchen area grease-free and avoid any type of accidents.<\/span>\r\n<h3><b>Stay Code-Compliant:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <\/span><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The NFPA has outlined clear safety guidelines for commercial kitchens and restaurants to follow. As a responsible business owner, you should always adhere to these codes to operate your facility in a safe and healthy environment and have the law on your side.<\/span>\r\n<h3><b>Save Money:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <\/span><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One key benefit of kitchen hood cleaning is that you will be able to save a lot of money in the long term. Imagine what could happen, if the grease deposits in your facility are not removed. This can lead to potential fire breakouts and damages to both lives and property. Proper cleaning also prolongs the lifespan of the range hood system and other equipment.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Let Us Help You Select the Right Cleaning Frequency<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Among other things, the National Fire Protection Association also recommends how many times you should clean the exhaust hood of your kitchen in a month or year. Make sure you pick the right frequency. At Hood Builder, our professionals will guide and advise you in this aspect as well.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The cleaning frequency that is right for you depends on a number of things such as whether you use solid fuel and the volume of cooking that is performed in your kitchen on a daily basis. Monthly cleaning is ideal for those restaurants that use wood, coal, or charcoal as fuel. If you do not use solid fuel but have a high volume of cooking, you should get the range hood cleaned on a quarterly basis. Commercial kitchens with a moderate volume of cooking should get the cleaning done on a semi-annual basis to keep the working environment safe.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No matter what type of fuel you use or how much cooking is done in your kitchen, our professionals will educate you on the cleaning aspect and help you choose the most ideal frequency of cleaning.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Do You Operate a Commercial Kitchen?<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you run a commercial kitchen, cafeteria, or dining facility, you should pay serious attention to exhaust hood cleaning.

For any large restaurant to operate with maximum productivity, its plumbing has to be strong. A commercial kitchen is a hub of activities including cooking, food preparation, dishwashing, steam sanitization, etc. All these operations can run smoothly only when the plumbing design and installation have been done in an effective manner. That is exactly why every large food facility owner requires commercial plumbing services.\r\n\r\nIgnoring proper plumbing in a large restaurant or kitchen will only take its toll on the working environment and slow down operation. So, make sure you pay serious attention to this aspect of your business.\r\n<h2>Hood Builder: Your Ideal Commercial Plumbing Partner<\/h2>\r\nHood Builder delivers quality commercial plumbing services to organizations like yours across the country. Our plumbing technicians are highly-trained, professional, and personable. Using the very best equipment and materials, we can get any sized job done quickly and to your exact specifications.\r\n\r\nWhether you need a simple faucet installed or a complete sewer line replaced, Hood Builder can provide you with a wide range of commercial plumbing services to meet your growing needs.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li>Drain cleaning<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Water heater installation<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Water leak detection<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Water leak repairs<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Toilet and faucet installation<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Faulty plumbing systems<\/li>\r\n \t<li>Clogged drain lines<\/li>\r\n \t<li>And more<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\nWe have a client-first mentality, which means that we strive to provide the best customer service on your budget and always on time. We treat your location with respect, we keep you informed every step of the way, and we never hit you with hidden charges. What you see is what you get, and that’s plumbing expertise fast when you need it for a hassle-free business operation.\r\n<h2>Gas Lines for Commercial Kitchen<\/h2>\r\nA restaurant is a place where a variety of food is prepared and served. Cooking and food preparation continue for hours on end to fulfill the orders of guests in an efficient manner. For this reason, a commercial kitchen needs to be outfitted with a well-laid network of gas lines.\r\n\r\nWhen installing gas lines, it is essential to complete the setup as per the specific daily needs of the kitchen. On top of that, the installation needs to be carried out keeping the possible future expansion in mind. If the gas line system is not flexible, you will end up wasting a lot of money getting it all removed and laying out the system afresh. By hiring commercial plumbing services, you will be able to have the entire project completed in a strategic and futuristic manner.\r\n<h2>New Plumbing Installations<\/h2>\r\nSetting up a new restaurant is a complicated process, which involves many different types of installations to be performed properly. To make a good impact on customers and keep the staff happy, business owners should install new toilets and accessories in the kitchen in a way that seamlessly blends with the overall interior design of the food facility or restaurant.\r\n\r\nCommercial plumbers understand the water supply, sinks, and faucets requirements better than anyone else. They carry out all these installations to make sure plumbing functions steadily and smoothly.\r\n<h2>Drainage System Installation<\/h2>\r\nWaste management in a commercial restaurant is a critical concern. If you operate a large kitchen or a food facility, you will need to deal with a great deal of waste on a daily basis. Unless you have properly installed sewers and drains, productivity will be affected and your business will suffer.\r\n\r\nBy hiring a commercial plumbing service, you will ensure proper and accurate plumbing installation. If the sewers and drains function efficiently, the risk of blockages in the system will be minimized. When building a large restaurant, drainage should always remain a top priority. For the drains and sewers to work properly, their installation needs to be done in the perfect location. Effective drainage is of utmost importance to keep the restaurant atmosphere hygienic as well as ensure that everything operates in the facility exactly as it should.\r\n<h2>Grease Traps Installation<\/h2>\r\nA crucial part of restaurant plumbing is the installation of<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/general-contracting\/grease-trap\/\"> grease traps<\/a>. This will help avoid blockages in the drainage system.\r\n\r\nThe primary water drainage system often gets blocked due to the solid waste that might travel down the piping. That is why commercial plumbing specialists install grease traps below sinks throughout the kitchen and the dining area. The grease traps effectively capture solid waste and oily waste materials and prevent drainage blockages as a result. A commercial kitchen is fitted with another system to manage this type of waste and thus ensures uninterrupted operation.\r\n<h2>Plumbing Maintenance and Repair<\/h2>\r\nWhile it is crucial to get the plumbing in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/restaurant-services\/\">commercial restaurant<\/a> installed by experts, you should also give the entire system proper maintenance on a weekly basis with the help of restaurant plumbers.\r\n\r\nIn a large, busy kitchen, issues with the gas lines, sewers, and drains do happen from time to time. If you plan to run your foodservice business in a hassle-free manner, you should seek the help of plumbers to give your plumbing weekly maintenance and repair minor issues as soon as they arise. Do not hire ordinary plumbers though, as they lack professional experience and in-depth knowledge of how the entire plumbing network in a large restaurant or kitchen functions. For top-notch service, hire only professional restaurant plumbers to carry out the job.\r\n<h2>Talk to Our Restaurant Plumbing Specialists<\/h2>\r\nThe moment you call Hood Builder for any size of plumbing job, we will send our trained technicians to your location.

Behind this remains hidden the supporting structure, which includes the foundation, beams, columns, walls, slabs, and many other elements to hold up the weight. Structural engineering plays a crucial role in giving a building the supporting strength it needs to stand the test of time. Make sure you get this project done by expert professionals.\r\n<h3>Hood Builder: Your Most Trusted Structural Engineering Partner<\/h3>\r\nHood Builder is one of the leading providers of engineering and surveying services to clients in a variety of industries nationwide.

Our professionals will conduct the entire review process following the best standards of quality.

That is why engineers need to consider a number of factors such as the location of the structure, type of structure, load magnitude, ground conditions, etc. In many site locations, the ground conditions are not favorable. Experts need to assess all of these and create a foundational design for the building in accordance with code compliance issues and seismic concerns.\r\n\r\nOur experienced engineers and draftsmen will develop the most efficient design for a highly stable and strong foundation. They will complete the process while adhering to all the building codes and regulations.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/restaurant-remodeling-tips\/\"><strong>Read More: Restaurant Remodel Tips: 10 Creative Tips you should know<\/strong><\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2>Focused on Your Complete Satisfaction<\/h2>\r\nWe have worked with some of the biggest names in business today, including Starbucks, McDonald’s, and The Olive Garden.

That is exactly why you need to install a high-quality fire suppression system in the restaurant.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to train the employees to adopt practices that prevent the occurrence of fire in commercial restaurants. What is even more important is the installation of a fire suppression system, which uses the most advanced technology and gets activated swiftly in the event of a fire. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When looking for a fire protection system, one name that beats all other brands is the Ansul fire suppression system.

As a responsible business owner, you need to prioritize the safety of your property, staff and guests.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"big-para-blue\">The risk of fire in a commercial kitchen or restaurant is very common. In fact, many business owners had to suffer heavy financial losses or shut down their operation altogether as a result of fire accidents.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"big-para-blue\">&gt;A fire suppression system is designed to knock down fires in the initial stage. It is made up of multiple components or a group of units that extinguish fire through the application of a substance. The main role of this solution is to detect the warning signals of a likely fire due to heat, smoke and grease buildup. Kitchen and cooking equipment as well as electrical equipment often present fire hazards, which are effectively reduced by using and installing a fire protection system.<\/span><\/p>\r\n[\/vc_column_text][ultimate_spacer height=\"60\" height_on_mob_landscape=\"40\" height_on_mob=\"40\"][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][ultimate_spacer height=\"90\" height_on_mob_landscape=\"70\" height_on_mob=\"70\"][\/vc_column][vc_column offset=\"vc_col-lg-7 vc_col-md-7\"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h2>Hood Builder Recommends Pyrochem Fire Suppression System<\/h2>\r\nFor top-grade fire protection, it is crucial to select and invest in an innovative solution that has been engineered to protect the ventilating hood, exhaust duct, grease filters, and cooking appliances effectively.\r\n\r\nAt Hood Builder, we have been outfitting commercial kitchens and restaurants with fire suppression systems for over two decades.

Grease ducts are designed to collect that grease, but what happens to all the grease that’s collected? If not cleaned properly, grease can form flammable droplets that accumulate on the surfaces of your exhaust system, as well as on the roof and nearby walls. Grease can even wreak havoc by gumming up your exhaust fans, making them less efficient. By far the most dangerous aspect of accumulated grease is that it can spread throughout your building via the ductwork, leaving your kitchen at risk for a destructive and deadly grease fire. <\/span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1-303-777-7720\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote 303-777-7720<\/a><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"padding-top: 20px;\"><b>Shepherd Grease Filters Keep Airborne Grease to an Absolute Minimum <\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span>The folks at Shepherd saw a need for a hood filter that kept grease from entering the, exhaust system altogether. This led to the creation of the Shepherd disposable grease filter, the safe, disposable, and environmentally friendly grease filter that is singlehandedly changing the industry.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span>Shepherd filters work by capturing and reducing up to 98% of airborne grease before it can be allowed to enter your kitchen’s exhaust system. The filters are easy to install, designed for fire protection, and made of all-natural ingredients making them 100% biodegradable. Made in Australia with fire-retardant Australian wool, Shepherd filters are also designed to conserve water while saving you money.<\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>Commercial Grease Cleaner - Eliminates Costly Cleaning, Saving Water, Time &amp; Money<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span>Common grease filters must be cleaned on a regular basis, which can lead to hefty expenses over time. Frequent hood cleaning requires an immense amount of water, and chemical cleaners don’t come cheap. Then there is staff overtime to consider, and even then, there is no guarantee that all the grease will be removed, unless <\/span><a href=\"\/\"><span>professional vent hood cleaners<\/span><\/a><span> are called in to do the job. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span>Fire codes requires that exhaust systems be cleaned to the bare metal in order to ensure all the caked-on grease is removed. That’s because a clean exhaust system can’t catch fire. Clean fans also tend to run at maximum efficiency, keeping the air quality in your kitchen running at optimum levels. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span>For commercial kitchen operators who want a cleaner, safer, and more efficient environment for their staff, Shepherd disposable filters are the obvious choice. <\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>Clean Range Hood Filter - Completely Disposable &amp; Environmentally Friendly<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span>Shepherd filters can be installed in seconds and go to work immediately to keep airborne grease at bay. When their job is done, the filters can be disposed of with your regular trash while reducing your environmental footprint. That makes Shepherd filters the primary choice for many restaurants, clubs, sporting venues, cafes, and hotels. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"\/services\/restaurant-services\/cleaning\/\"><span>Hood Builder<\/span><\/a><span> is proud to offer Shepherd disposable filters for commercial kitchens who want to keep costs down while preventing fires and protecting the environment in Denver and Colorado.

Because of various factors, including infrastructural issues within the HVAC system, the presence of too many electric and electronic devices (stoves\/TVs\/computer monitors) or even the furniture placement in the room, airflow can become unbalanced. Air balancing is a service that seeks to correct this problem, making the HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning systems) in the building or home more efficient and the room climate more comfortable.<\/span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1-303-777-7720\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (303-777-7720)<\/a><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h2><b>Air Balancing (Defined)<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HVAC air balancing optimizes the HVAC system to best ensure that air becomes evenly distributed throughout a building. This involves inspecting all elements of the system, cleaning ducts, replacing or refitting ducts and dampers. Beyond visual inspection of these elements, air balancing also involves testing, adjusting, and balancing services. A series of tests is performed that determines the problem areas  in each home\/building. This allows Certified Air Balance technicians to fix\/modify the elements of HVAC that are causing the issue, thus balancing airflow. The result is a building with improved, cleaner air quality, less temperature dips and highs, no hot\/cold spots, and doors that are neither too hard to open (negative air) or drafty and open (excess positive air).<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Why Air Balancing?<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Oftentimes, unbalanced airflow is a silent problem that the owners of the home or business are not aware of, except for rising AC and heating bills. When left unattended, this can cost thousands of dollars per year. If there is too much positive air in a room, it will pull outside air in, which can cause the building to become too hot or too cold, depending on the weather. The people inside adjust the thermostat to compensate for the inconsistent temperature, producing a very costly energy inefficiency that is so easily preventable with the help of Certified Air Balancing.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, when there is too much negative air, the room will suck air from window and door cracks, trash bins, etc. creating an unpleasant air quality inside the building. This taxes the HVAC system as it struggles to filter the air. Eventually, the excessive harmful particles sucked up in a negative building will overwhelm the system, allowing unfiltered air to circulate, jeopardizing the health of its occupants.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When an unbalanced airflow in a building becomes apparent, it can cause great discomfort and annoyance to the people within. In a home, this means an unwelcoming atmosphere for its occupants, and for a business, this can precipitate falling employee morale and productivity.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>HVAC System Performance and Air Balancing<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every building is equipped with a Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning system, and that system needs to be tested for proper and optimal performance prior to use and throughout its lifespan. An extensive battery of tests examining various aspects of a building’s HVAC system is necessary to understanding your HVAC system performance thoroughly.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>HVAC Air Balancing &amp; Testing.<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tests done by certified air balancing professionals determine HVAC system performance by looking individually at: energy use and its efficiency, air purification testing (examines indoor air quality) and airflow testing. An unbalanced pressure buildup in a building will negatively affect the performance of all HVAC system functions and vice versa. A deficiency in the infrastructure of the HVAC system will contribute to uneven distribution of air throughout the home or business building. This is why it’s important to perform air balance adjustments with a trusted company.<\/span>\r\n<b><\/b>\r\n<h2><b>Common Causes of Airflow Problems Fixed by Air Balance Adjustments<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<h3 style=\"display: inline-block;\">Missing dampers:<\/h3>\r\n<span>Dampers are plates that open and close to direct air towards or away from specified sections of the building to accommodate the needs of different zones (rooms\/levels). When they are missing, air is distributed incorrectly, causing temperature inconsistencies.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<h3 style=\"display: inline-block;\">Restrictive ducts:<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; display: inline-block;\">Air ducts made with the wrong material create air friction and turbulence. Fittings of a tight elbow shape make airflow harder, forcing the HVAC system to work overtime to push air through.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<h3 style=\"display: inline-block;\">Duct leakage:<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; display: inline-block;\">The integrity of the material of the ducts and the connective fittings can greatly affect airflow. Brittle materials with no flex allow breaks to happen; rodents can chew through ducts, creating holes. Huge amounts of conditioned air can be lost through leaking ducts, causing energy inefficiency.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<h3 style=\"display: inline-block;\">Blower problems:<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; display: inline-block;\"> When the blower fan is damaged, there is no steady pushing of air to be cooled or heated. Slow airflow through the ducts taxes the HVAC system.<\/span><\/li>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<h3 style=\"display: inline-block;\">Restrictive coils and filters:<\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; display: inline-block;\"> Dust, grease, dirt and other contaminants can clog up the condenser coil of the cooling system, causing decreased airflow. Dirty filters can also cause air friction, contributing to turbulence within the ducts and making airflow much slower.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<strong>For a full and fast price quote, contact Hood Builder today.<\/strong>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1-303-777-7720\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (303-777-7720)<\/a><\/p>\r\n[\/vc_column_text][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][vc_column_text]\r\n<h2><b>Certified Air Balancing<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span>Certified Air Balancing is Air Balancing performed by trained, accredited and certified air balancing professionals. Air balancing can be attempted by general handymen but is an art form best left to certified air balancing technicians that have completed the Testing, Adjusting and Balancing Certification Program. Certified Air Balancing is done by technicians that have been approved by NEBB or similar accrediting body, passing examinations issued by their accrediting institution as well as having completed a certain amount of working\/supervising hours. HVAC firms applying for certified status must have a  senior technician on staff who checks, approves, and signs off on all air balancing jobs. This individual must pass a certified professional written exam as well as a report review exam. The certified testing engineers must have 8 years of air balancing experience or an engineering degree with 4 years of on the job experience. They have to oversee various aspects within their company–instrument calibration, technician training, and safety. They also must also submit their company’s standard operating procedures to NEBB to incur certification for their company.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span>Individual contractors seeking certification must pass rigorous testing and complete two years of hands-on training to achieve certification.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>WHY CHOOSE A CERTIFIED AIR BALANCING CONTRACTOR<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span>While air balancing prior to the opening of a new building at the end of construction is somewhat simpler, service calls to homes and older buildings with deteriorating infrastructure require something more.  Education, intuition, and experience are necessary for this more complicated kind of job. This is why choosing a professional certified in air balancing, testing, and reporting is so important. Certified Air Balancing technicians are experts at troubleshooting irregular ductwork problems as well as cleaning and repairing aging HVAC elements. They also usually have the full range of tools necessary to test and adjust even the most challenging airflow problem, as opposed to HVAC generalists.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Commercial Air Balancing Certification Program<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span>Individual contractors can seek air balance certification through several available courses. The International Training Institute (ITI) of Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Industry offers various training options over the course of either one or two years. The Testing, Adjusting and Balancing Bureau initiated the TABB certification, which sets a standard for HVAC companies and individual contractors seeking to specialize in air balancing. All companies vying for TABB certified status must have at least one person on staff who has passed all written tests and is in good standing with NEBB. Individuals with TABB certification must have at least several years of experience performing and supervising air balancing services as well as having passed the examinations. The central bodies offering certification in air balancing to HVAC\/ air balancing companies are the National Environmental Balancing Bureau (NEBB), the National Comfort Institute, The Associated Air Balancing Council, and the National Balancing Council.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span>Commercial Air Balancing Certification prepares technicians for inspecting commercial buildings and testing the performance of the HVAC systems therein. This involves sealing off the building, closing dampers at each opening, adjusting them, and measuring airflow. When balanced airflow is achieved, the settings are locked in for optimal function. Certified technicians can do the initial adjustments as well as skillfully service older systems that need to have their ducts, coils and other elements inspected\/repaired. Because they are knowledgeable about the hows and the whys of various <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/HVAC_control_system\">HVAC system<\/a> problems, they are able to efficiently troubleshoot to find the root problems instead of providing band aid solutions that eventually wear down the system.

However, a grease interceptor is not just a part that fits under the sink-- it is a self-standing, much larger item. It's commonly placed outside the establishment that uses it, underground. A trench is dug, the interceptor is lowered into it, and a concrete slab placed on top. An extension collar runs from the interceptor buried several feet below the ground to the access point at ground level. These large plumbing devices are mandatory for restaurants in many municipalities to pass building code regulations. Grease interceptors must be pumped regularly to remove the greasy sludge on top of the water (when it fills 25 percent of the interceptor’s capacity). The pump machine is attached to the access point that is connected by a sort of hose to the underground grease interceptor. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][ultimate_spacer height=\"60\" height_on_mob_landscape=\"40\" height_on_mob=\"40\"][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][ultimate_spacer height=\"90\" height_on_mob_landscape=\"70\" height_on_mob=\"70\"][\/vc_column][vc_column offset=\"vc_col-lg-7 vc_col-md-7\"][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How much does it cost to install a grease interceptor?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The price range for grease interceptor installation varies widely, but the average range across the US is from 3000 to 6000 dollars. There are many factors that could push that price up or down. First, if the grease interceptor is one that has an 800 gallon capacity, it's installation price will be different from a 2500 gallon unit. Additionally, automatic grease interceptors are much more sophisticated and expensive than gravity interceptors. Installing a grease interceptor is a more involved process than just putting in a simple grease trap. Trained professionals use a complicated algorithm. They figure out the volume capacity of each sink, adjust for water displacement, and determine the flowrate of water. That helps them select the correctly sized unit.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>What is the difference between a grease interceptor and a grease trap?<\/b><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grease traps and interceptors are very similar in function but they also differ in several ways. Both essentially separate oil and grease from water. However, a grease interceptor is larger than a grease trap and can handle a higher volume of outflowing waste water: more than 50 gallons per minute, whereas the grease trap’s capacity tops out at 50 gals\/minute. Also, while grease traps are directly under the sink, interceptors are located outside the building. Grease interceptors are usually necessary for restaurants, where large amounts of oil are used and discarded, while grease traps are the more logical options for homes.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Types of grease interceptors:<\/b><\/h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><b>Gravity Grease Interceptors<\/b><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These are passive interceptors that just separate the food, oil, and grease from the water as it flows down. Each unit is able to hold only a small percentage of grease in its total capacity and needs to be pumped every three months to remove it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><b>Automatic Grease Interceptors<\/b><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These machines are able to hold much more grease within them. Automatic grease interceptor efficiency is much higher because they both stop the FOG (food, oil, grease) from entering the plumbing and sewage system and they skim it off into a separate container. Though their price is more upfront, they save the facilities that use them countless dollars over time in pumping fees.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><b>Maximum-Retention Hydromechanical Grease Interceptors <\/b><\/em><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These interceptors are more compact than the traditional units but they hold a lot more grease-- about 85 percent of their total capacity. They're often made of plastic or fiberglass that are much longer lasting than the steel or concrete most commonly used on gravity-based units.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you'd like to install a grease interceptor for your Denver area restaurant, call Hoodbuilder at <span><a href=\"tel:+1-303-777-7720\">303-777-7720<\/a><\/span>.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column offset=\"vc_col-lg-offset-1 vc_col-lg-4 vc_col-md-offset-1 vc_col-md-4\"][vc_wp_custommenu nav_menu=\"14\" el_class=\"wps-sidebar-related-links\" title=\"Related Links\"][templatera id=\"192\"][\/vc_column][vc_column][ultimate_spacer height=\"90\" height_on_mob_landscape=\"70\" height_on_mob=\"70\"][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row full_width=\"wps-full-width\"][vc_column][templatera id=\"96\"][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","post_title":"Grease Interceptor","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"grease-interceptor","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2023-11-19 04:50:19","post_modified_gmt":"2023-11-19 04:50:19","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"12","guid":"http:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/?page_id=1172","menu_order":"0","post_type":"page","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","image":"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/?p=2590","author":"Massoud Farazandeh"},

The Environmental Protection Agency’s report to Congress in 2004 stated that the most common cause for sewer overflows is grease coming from residential, commercial and restaurant wastewater. Controlling fat, oil and grease discharges significantly helps reduce blockages and clogging of the waste water\/ sewage system. The grease trap design is one of the most effective ways to control fats, oils, and grease. Wastewater leaving the kitchen enters into the grease trap. Fats oils and grease are lighter than water, therefore are separated and float to the top of the trap\/ interceptor. Solid waste that enters the trap will sink to the bottom. By trapping grease into the device it allows wastewater to continue into the sewage system preventing grease build up and clogs in sewage pipes.<\/span><\/p>\r\n[\/vc_column_text][ultimate_spacer height=\"60\" height_on_mob_landscape=\"40\" height_on_mob=\"40\"][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][ultimate_spacer height=\"90\" height_on_mob_landscape=\"70\" height_on_mob=\"70\"][\/vc_column][vc_column offset=\"vc_col-lg-7 vc_col-md-7\"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How much does it cost to put in a grease trap?<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grease trap prices vary due to size and the kind you choose. Residential grease traps will cost several hundred dollars plus installation. Commercial gravity grease traps will be several thousand.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>What is a grease trap in a home?<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A residential grease trap looks like a box that is attached to the drain pipe under your sink. It uses baffles, a paddle-like attachment and also filters to separate water from grease and debris.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>How often do you need to clean a grease trap?<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A hydromechanical under-sink grease trap or a grease trap that sits adjacent to a sink or dishwasher-- can get by with cleanings every week and up to three months.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A bigger gravity grease trap or interceptor tank located underground needs to be pumped every 90 days. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>What is grease trap service?<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A grease trap cleaning service basically pumps the oil\/ grease and debris from the holding tank and disposes of this residue, leaving your facility or restaurant grease trap ready to continue its job most efficiently. Without regular and professional grease trap service, you will be facing much bigger problems down the road. Fixing grease trap parts or replacing piping will cost thousands, not hundreds of dollars, unlike regular pumping services.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Types of grease trap<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are two main grease trap designs. The first is the smaller hydromechanical system that uses baffles and filters to force sediment, oil, and water apart. This is what you typically see in a residential or small kitchen.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The other kind is a passive gravity grease trap or interceptor. It is bigger and usually underground or outside the home\/facility that uses it. It has a bigger tank where water flows in, then gravity allows sediment to settle, oil floats to the top, and water flows out.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Why do I need a grease trap?<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When oil, food, and especially animal fat that solidifies at room temperature-- is poured down the drain, it presents a risk to one’s plumbing system. This is because it sticks to the inside of the pipes, forming a sticky surface that attracts solid particles.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over time, this mass becomes calcified and solid, obstructing normal water flow and causing backups. The pipes themselves corrode much faster when this happens. To avoid smelly, annoying backups that often attract pests like roaches, and to prolong the life of your pipes, grease traps are absolutely necessary. <\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Grease trap efficiency<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Grease trap efficiency depends heavily on whether the device is the right size for your needs and whether it is cleaned often enough. First, a grease trap for a restaurant needs to be bigger than a residential grease trap. Restaurants, hospitals, and schools typically require commercial grease traps or interceptors.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Grease trap design allows some grease and particles to escape and was never meant to catch all FOG (food, oil, grease). However, if you are running a big kitchen, the amount of oil and solid residue escaping into your pipes may be too large, causing your grease trap to become full too soon and thereafter, permitting most of the FOG right through to your pipeline.<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even if your grease trap is properly sized for your establishment but it is not routinely cleaned, the same inefficiency will occur.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>What size is right for you?<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em><strong>To determine the size of grease trap you need, there is a formula plumbers use:<\/strong><\/em><b><\/b><\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n \t<li>Determine the capacity of the sink (length x depth x width)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n \t<li>Once you know the volume of the sink in cubic inches, convert it to gallons of water per minute that need to drain from the sink.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\n \t<li>Adjust that number by accounting for water displacement. Now, you have the flow rate in gallons per minute (GPM). Grease traps and interceptor sizes are all based on the GPM metric, so now you can find the corresponding unit.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>The calculations are slightly different for multiple compartment sinks and your grease trap will be bigger if you are hooking up the dishwasher along with the sink.<\/b><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>If you are in Denver area and require commercial or residential grease trap cleaning, please call Hoodbuilder at <span><a href=\"tel:1-303-777-7720\">303-777-7720<\/a><\/span>.<\/b><\/p>\r\n[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column offset=\"vc_col-lg-offset-1 vc_col-lg-4 vc_col-md-offset-1 vc_col-md-4\"][vc_wp_custommenu nav_menu=\"14\" el_class=\"wps-sidebar-related-links\" title=\"Related Links\"][templatera id=\"192\"][\/vc_column][vc_column][ultimate_spacer height=\"90\" height_on_mob_landscape=\"70\" height_on_mob=\"70\"][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row full_width=\"wps-full-width\"][vc_column][templatera id=\"96\"][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]","post_title":"Grease Trap","post_excerpt":"","post_status":"publish","comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","post_password":"","post_name":"grease-trap","to_ping":"","pinged":"","post_modified":"2023-11-19 05:18:25","post_modified_gmt":"2023-11-19 05:18:25","post_content_filtered":"","post_parent":"219","guid":"http:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/?page_id=1159","menu_order":"0","post_type":"page","post_mime_type":"","comment_count":"0","image":"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/?p=2606","author":"Massoud Farazandeh"},

Kitchen vent hoods keep grease and oil and other particles from contaminating the air and food. After a fire, extra precaution needs to be taken to ensure the hoods and the ducting that connects them to your HVAC system are free of any contaminants, including soot, dust, dirt, bacteria, and spores. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hoodbuilder will ensure the air stays clear, and your food untainted after a fire has ravaged your restaurant business.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Smoke, Soot, Odor &amp; Mold Removal <\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the prime reasons you should hire fire restoration experts is because we understand how to remove odor and mold from areas where those things might otherwise thrive.

Food trucks or trailers and mobile restaurants sound quite exciting. But it is not as simple as it may sound. To start a restaurant on wheels, you need to efficiently plan a couple of things.

Depending on specific requirements, the design varies from one food truck to another. Whether it is finding the right dimensions or creating an interior layout which makes an efficient use of the space, you need to hire the services of an expert. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Hood Builder, we offer professional food truck design services. Our team of experts are quite well-versed in working with a range of dimensions and designing a modern, functional layout for food trucks. We have successfully designed a wide variety of commercial kitchen layouts in keeping with specific needs of businesses, clients and entrepreneurs all across the country.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dimensions of a food truck or food trailer is of crucial importance. From the right selection of the vehicle to creating a layout which makes the best use of the available space, every key aspect requires serious consideration and in-depth knowledge of how a mobile food service operates. When designing the layout of a food truck, the length of the truck plays a key role. Using a range of templates, we help our clients choose the right dimension for their food trucks. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The food truck needs to be designed in a way which accommodates all the essential equipment which goes into a commercial kitchen. The design engineer creates a floor plan which includes space for the refrigeration equipment, cooking equipment, work stations, cabinet, serving counter, ventilation etc. Hood Builder is a Denver-based company which specializes in designing custom food trucks and trailers. Over the years, we have mastered the art and science of building and designing food trucks and catering trailers as per the specific needs of clients. If you have made up your mind to start a food truck business, you should head straight to our office or give us a phone call so that we can discuss what your specific needs are and then come up with a custom, highly functional design layout for your food truck.<\/span>[\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text]In the following, we will introduce some of the most popular models of food combos and their specifications and features.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_tta_tabs][vc_tta_section title=\"250W trailer\" tab_id=\"1613910375543-a0ebc575-28dc\"][wpdatatable id=\"1\"][\/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title=\"300W trailer\" tab_id=\"1613910375583-07e1c141-b3aa\"][wpdatatable id=\"2\"][\/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title=\"400W trailer\" tab_id=\"1613910377226-18d1c0b6-a5ed\"][wpdatatable id=\"3\"][\/vc_tta_section][\/vc_tta_tabs][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\r\n<h2><b>Food Truck Fire Suppression: Installation, Maintenance, Repair<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most of the mobile food trucks and trailers have a kitchen for cooking and preparing food on a daily basis. Just like other commercial kitchens, the kitchen in your food truck needs protection against fire hazards as well. Spontaneous fire ignition can put the lives of your staff at risk as well as put your assets in danger. Having a fire suppression system installed in your mobile kitchen will ensure the safety of your staff and minimize the chances of property damage.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Usually, the fire suppression system of a food truck looks similar to that of a regular commercial kitchen. However, installation requirements may vary depending on the size and dimensions of the food truck.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modern fire suppression systems are extremely efficient and active. In the event of a fire, the system reacts immediately and the entire system becomes active. The system is engineered to be so sensitive that it instantly detects an increase in temperature and if the situation is dangerous, the fire system immediately cuts off the fuel supply and starts to dispense the extinguishing agent. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you plan to operate your food truck business in a safe and worry-free manner, you should never ignore the need for the installation of a fire suppression system. Unless you have a fire suppression system in place, your food truck will be like a rolling fire hazard. This can jeopardize not just the lives of your own employees but the lives of your customers too. Hood Builder offers high quality solutions for increased protection against fire safety hazards in food trucks. We provide all kinds of high quality, branded fire suppression systems that you may need for your food trucks and food catering trailer business.

It is a space where food cooking and preparation goes on for hours on end. Unlike a home kitchen, the food truck kitchen is not easy to maintain and keep clean. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On a regular basis, the staff in your food truck cooks and stores food. Plus, there are cooking equipment that need cleaning on a daily basis so that food can be served again. There are extensive benefits of maintaining the kitchen of your food truck. Regular cleaning and maintenance will give your cooking equipment a long life. You invest a lot of money in the kitchen equipment. It is important that you take proper care of all the kitchen equipment and the vent hood. This will help you avoid costly repairs and save a lot of money in the long term. The darin and the water inlets need proper cleaning so that they function smoothly. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to cleaning a mobile kitchen, the exhaust hood systems need serious attention. Installing an exhaust hood system immediately increases the safety of your employees and the assets by keeping the kitchen space free from heat and smoke. But the vent hood also collects grease over time. If the cooking frequency is high, the buildup of grease will be even more. This greasy buildup is a fire safety hazard and it must be cleaned properly.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it is the vent hood, the fire suppression system or the exhaust fan of your mobile restaurant, you need to watch out for greasy buildup and get it cleaned to minimize the chances of fire accidents.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Hood Builder, we carry several years of experience in commercial kitchen and vent hood cleaning services. Our well-trained and highly dedicated team of cleaners are equipped with all the latest products, tools and techniques to perform an excellent cleaning job for your mobile kitchen. You’ll find many other mobile kitchen cleaning companies operating out there. However, you should choose to work with only those who have a proven track record and certified cleaners. Hood Builder is just the ideal kitchen cleaning company you’ll want to work with. We use food-safe agents, the latest tools and technology and use water efficiently. Our track record for successfully conducting kitchen cleaning service is proven. <\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our mobile kitchen cleaning services include cleaning and removal of grease from the vent hood (internal and external), hood filters, exhaust fans, ductwork etc. Shining kitchen hoods is a sign of increased fire protection and it enables you to abide by NFPA regulations. Also, we examine all the kitchen equipment and the hood system for any component which may have worn out and needs replacement. Fixing minor issues in time keeps out expensive repairs later.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the volume of cooking that goes on in your food truck or catering trailer, you can schedule our cleaning services on a monthly, quarterly or semi-annually basis.

As per the directions of the United States Department of Agriculture, business owners are required to store refrigerated food at or below 40°F and frozen food at 0°F. That is exactly where the role of walk-in coolers and freezers comes into play. If you run a commercial kitchen, restaurant, cafeteria or food facility, you need to maintain a specific temperature for the storage of frozen or pre-cooked food items for safe human consumption as well as stay compliant with safety codes as outlined by the local regulatory bodies.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For guidance on how walk-in coolers and walk-in freezers are designed and installed in commercial food establishments, what features they come with and how to maintain them properly, keep on reading.<\/span>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"tel:+1-303-777-7720\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px 10px 20px; background-color: #0067ab;\">Free Quote (303-777-7720)<\/a><\/p>\r\n[\/vc_column_text][ultimate_spacer height=\"60\" height_on_mob_landscape=\"40\" height_on_mob=\"40\"][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][ultimate_spacer height=\"90\" height_on_mob_landscape=\"70\" height_on_mob=\"70\"][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column width=\"2\/3\"][vc_column_text]\r\n<h2><b>Introduction<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Walk-in coolers and walk-in freezers are cold room chambers where refrigerated or frozen food is safely stored. Food items such as meat, fruit, vegetables, and frozen items need to be kept at specific temperatures. Compared to standard refrigerators, walk-in coolers and freezers provide food storage for the long term. Restaurant owners are required to store these food items at low temperatures so that the latter don’t perish by the growth of bacteria and fungus.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A commercial walk-in cooler or cold room operates at temperatures between 0°c and 5°c whereas a walk-in freezer is used for storage below the freezing point. A walk-in freezer is designed to operate at sub-zero temperatures and as low as -40°c so that it freezes the food items kept inside.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>walk-in coolers Features and Facilities<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The walk-in storage spaces are large enough to provide proper storage for all the non-perishable items in a food facility or kitchen. The size of a walk-in cooler can be the size of a room or much larger than that. Usually, these refrigerated storage spaces have an area of less than 3,000 sq, ft.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Broadly speaking, walk-ins fall in three categories: self-contained, remote condensing, and multiplex condensing. Each of these walk-ins is designed with unique features and functionalities to match the specific needs of a large restaurant or commercial kitchen. If it is a self-contained walk-in, it will have both the evaporator and the condenser built in one unit. This type of walk-in cooler or freezer is set up outside the building where the food facility is located. In a remote condensing walk-in, the evaporator and the condenser are set up separately. Multiplex walk-ins are built right in the building in which the food facility is located.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Walk-in coolers <\/b><b>design<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The design of all walk-ins is not the same. They vary as per the specific type of the walk-in you are going to install. However, the basic design principles that these systems follow remain the same.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For maximum operational efficiency, the walls of walk-in coolers and freezers have proper insulation. Not just the walls, but the ceilings and the floors of the entire unit are all insulated. The insulation is created by placing a layer of foam between two layers of steel or aluminum. The main purpose of the insulation is to separate the outside temperature from the inside temperature. Most of all, the insulation reduces strain on the evaporator and the condenser. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since the refrigerated storage space will be used to keep a large number of food items, its floors need proper reinforcements. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hoodbuilder.com\/services\/restaurant-services\/design\/\">Professionals design<\/a> the entire space keeping in mind the daily needs of the facility. Frequent entry into and exit from the walk-ins affect the inside temperature. This, as a result, increases energy consumption. That is why curtains are installed at the entrance of the walk-in. To minimize the rise and fall in the temperature, two types of curtains are used namely strip and air. Each of these curtains has a unique design, but both of them serve the same purpose, which is to reduce the fluctuations in the temperature.<\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>Walk-in cooler and freezer installation<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before the installation of a walk-in cooler or a walk-in freezer can begin, the details of the project have to be planned in an accurate manner. Though there are multiple reasons behind the failure of a new installation, one key reason is poor planning or improper preparation. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Hood Builder, we have a highly competent team of experts who carry several years of experience in the installation of walk-ins. We have a solid, proven track record as a commercial refrigeration installer all across Denver, Colorado. While we offer a lot of flexibility in terms of schedules, we focus on the exact needs of a food facility in terms of appropriate design, selection of refrigeration tech and carrying out the entire project in a hassle-free and timely manner. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before getting started with the procedure, we make sure that the location of the installation is fully prepared for the same. <\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From installing the base channels, assembling the walls, adding the ceiling panels, and placing the doors to installing the evaporator and the condenser as well as meeting all the electrical requirements, we pay serious attention to each crucial step of the procedure. For detailed information in this regard, feel free to reach out to one of our specialists at Hood Builder.<\/span>\r\n<h2><strong>Walk-in cooler and freezer <\/strong><b>replacement<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When issues arise with the performance of your walk-in cooler or freezer, you should never ignore them. Instead, you should seek professional help to get to the root cause of the problem as quickly as possible.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your walk-in is too old or one or more of its components have malfunctioned, you may need to replace the worn out parts. However, it is for the technicians to determine the actual problem and then suggest the most ideal solution. Replacement of some parts may be required if you are having temperature level issues or seeing high amounts of energy consumption. In many cases, replacing the compressor of the walk-in restores the entire unit to its brand new condition.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Hood Builder, we have highly trained technicians who can inspect your walk-in and replace the worn out components in an accurate and swift manner, so as to bring back the operation efficiency.<\/span>\r\n<h2><b>Repair and Maintenance<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Timely repair and maintenance will prolong the life of your walk-in cooler or freezer and save you money in the long term.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When operating a commercial cooling or freezing system, it is crucial to give it proper and timely maintenance. You may have some minor issues with the unit from time to time. What is important is that you pay quick attention and get the necessary repairs done fast by professionals.
